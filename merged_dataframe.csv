Walking in, it does seem like a throwback to 30 years ago, old fashioned menu board, booths out of the 70s, and a large selection of food. Their speciality is the Italian Hoagie, and it is voted the best in the area year after year. I usually order the burger, while the patties are obviously cooked from frozen, all of the other ingredients are very fresh. Overall, its a good alternative to Subway, which is down the road.	review	PUFPaY9KxDAcGqfsorJp3Q	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.08	{u'note': 1, u'plain': 1, u'hot': 1, u'more': 1}	[]	0	[]	Jeffrey	60	user	{u'funny': 25, u'useful': 166, u'cool': 12}	2009-05

And I think it was because I was expecting something completely different than I got. Latina Pizza is very different from most pizza shops. Instead if a round thin crust pizza, this pizza is square, thick, and doughy. The crust is not really that good, but that is not why you get a pizza here. It's the homemade sauce. And that it is a family owned place that is  really pretty inexpensive. 

The other nice thing about this shop is that it is right next to Kennywood. So usually around dinnertime we leave the park and walk over here to order some pizzas and drinks. No lines, no waiting for tables, no outrageous prices. It's a time to recharge, and sometimes we feel like going back to the park,  other times we decide to go home."	review	PUFPaY9KxDAcGqfsorJp3Q	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 4, u'cool': 0}	3.08	{u'note': 1, u'plain': 1, u'hot': 1, u'more': 1}	[]	0	[]	Jeffrey	60	user	{u'funny': 25, u'useful': 166, u'cool': 12}	2009-05

I have always left relatively satisfied. The food isn't quite as good as India Garden, but the buffet selection is bigger, and it's less expensive.

I tried one of these and it was excellent: a good combination of fresh baked bread, meat, spices, etc. I've stopped by a few times since, but you never really know what will be served, or if the place is even open. This is truly a one man operation, and definitely an experience in dining. So yes, make your reservation, bring a bottle of Hungarian Bull's Blood wine, and enjoy authentic Hungarian cooking and a social experience.	review	PUFPaY9KxDAcGqfsorJp3Q	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.08	{u'note': 1, u'plain': 1, u'hot': 1, u'more': 1}	[]	0	[]	Jeffrey	60	user	{u'funny': 25, u'useful': 166, u'cool': 12}	2009-05

Our main courses were packed with lobster, shrimp, steak, chicken, and potatoes which we dipped in the fondue pot of courses, with additional dipping sauces!  You gotta get desert - trust me!!

14	UsFtqoBl7naz8AVUBZMjQQ	2014-03-29	0Lua2-PbqEQMjD9r89-asw	3	We checked this place out this past Monday for their wing night. We have heard that their wings are great and decided it was finally time to check it out. Their wings are whole wings and crispy, which is a nice change of pace. I got their wet Cajun sauce and garlic butter wings. The Cajun did not have a bold enough flavor for me and their sauce is too thin. The sauce was also thin for the garlic butter, but that is more expected. They were better than average, but I don't like seeing all the sauce resting at the bottom of the boat. I would definitely come try this place out again to sample some of the other items on the menu, but this will probably not become a regular stop for wings anytime soon.	review	I_47G-R2_egp7ME5u_ltew	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.18	{u'hot': 1}	[]	1	[DsN2dJ6SnTEACr1qC5zpGg, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, NTQkWYICzFE2OrJLvDIKGg, L_Xi7cNe1heZd5hfQE_gQQ, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ]	Kevin	47	user	{u'funny': 8, u'useful': 46, u'cool': 10}	2011-11
15	1qCuOcks5HRv67OHovAVpg	2013-07-02	jqDpTYuOaluKUasBxJ_sVQ	1	Before today I probably would have given this place three stars based mostly on their beer selection; however, today the service was terrible. We waited two hours for a pizza sub, French onion soup, fries, and buffalo chicken tenders. About an hour and a half in we finally got the small pizza sub and the wrongly made buffalo chicken tenders (ie, no hot sauce). We were told by the waitress that she realized it was wrong, but decided to still bring it out to see if my gf would eat it. She sent it back. By a half hour later, we still had not received the buffalo chicken tenders, nor the French onion soup (which should have been mostly made already), and no fries.  We were told the chef was new, but no effort was made really to make the situation better. No quick and easy app or beers on the house. To boot, the beer was pretty expensive. I will probably give the place another chance based on their beer selection, but it won't be for a while. The food has always been average at best, and the pizza sub was no different. We ended up leaving after two hours without receiving 75% of our order.	review	I_47G-R2_egp7ME5u_ltew	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.18	{u'hot': 1}	[]	1	[DsN2dJ6SnTEACr1qC5zpGg, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, NTQkWYICzFE2OrJLvDIKGg, L_Xi7cNe1heZd5hfQE_gQQ, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ]	Kevin	47	user	{u'funny': 8, u'useful': 46, u'cool': 10}	2011-11

I was going to get a burger until I saw on the back of the menu that they do prime rib on Saturday evenings. For $19 you got a large cut of meat, which was pretty tasty, a large side salad, and I chose a loaded baked potato for the side. They were a little chintzy with the sides. The prime rib came with no horseradish sauce or au jus. I asked for a horseradish sauce, which they had, but the container was so small I had to ask for another. It was a similar situation with the large side salad. It was pretty big, and required at least a second side of dressing. The food was all pretty good, with the prime rib taking the lead and the baked potato bringing up the rear. As always, the beer selection was pretty solid and I really enjoyed my East End Brewery Monkey Boy.	review	I_47G-R2_egp7ME5u_ltew	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.18	{u'hot': 1}	[]	1	[DsN2dJ6SnTEACr1qC5zpGg, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, NTQkWYICzFE2OrJLvDIKGg, L_Xi7cNe1heZd5hfQE_gQQ, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ]	Kevin	47	user	{u'funny': 8, u'useful': 46, u'cool': 10}	2011-11

It has a neat atmosphere where the entrance has a nice bar and then there are a few other rooms that have the feeling of a living room or dining room. I really enjoy their brunches, but their pretzels are amazing. The one thing I don't like, which is a bit disappointing, is their potato pancakes. They are a little lumpy and not quite fried enough.

Now I'm not Peruvian and don't pretend to be an expert; however, I was somewhat recently in Peru for 10 days, including a few locations far from Lima. I also have a Peruvian sister-in-law, so I've tried homemade and authentic restaurant-style Peruvian food. 

None of the food here even sound Peruvian to me nor reminded me of Peruvian flavors. Where is the plethora of varieties of potatoes? Even Waffles Incaffeinated has mult-colored breakfast potatoes. A couple dishes seem like they could be inspired from some Latin American influences, but again, nothing like what I was expecting from my experience. With all that said we tried all 5 flavors of the empanadas they offered. They were OK at best and that was about as far as the line got pushed when it came to the main dishes. I tried the Tortilla de Papa, which was ok, but a little bland. The rice it came with was plain and the salad's dressing did not pack enough punch for me.

I see some other comments say that this is a hidden gem, but it is on the second floor above a deservedly better restaurant . This place also doesn't even look like a restaurant as it seems to be part market with all sorts of random knickknacks for sale. No where near as appealing as a Cracker Barrel.

Lastly, I saw a few comments say this is the best Peruvian restaurant in the city. I can't even understand how people came to that conclusion. I know there isn't a lot of options for this ethnicity, but Chicken Latino is miles better than this for starters."	review	I_47G-R2_egp7ME5u_ltew	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.18	{u'hot': 1}	[]	1	[DsN2dJ6SnTEACr1qC5zpGg, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, NTQkWYICzFE2OrJLvDIKGg, L_Xi7cNe1heZd5hfQE_gQQ, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ]	Kevin	47	user	{u'funny': 8, u'useful': 46, u'cool': 10}	2011-11

For a meal we had a salad with house Italian dressing which was very good. The mixed vegetables were steamed, could've used some seasoning and were frozen I believe. The potato dish was like a peeled baked potato that was sliced every quarter inch widthwise and had some sort of seasoning on top. It was ok, but I really just wanted sour cream, cheese, and bacon on top of it. Then, there was a tenderized breaded chicken dish that was pretty good.

I was hoping it was going to be a decent size portion, but it was on the smaller side. It was pretty good, but it was small and there wasn't much shrimp in it. I had a feeling it was going to be a smaller entree, so I went ahead and ordered a side of fries to get started. I should have asked first, but I didn't, and go figure, the fries are frozen (ie, not hand-cut). Personally, I feel, restaurants at this price range should be serving hand-cut fries standard. They do have Frank's hot sauce though, which is a plus always. I did not have any beer this day, so this review is only for the food. Service was decent, though I did have to ask for water a couple times before I got a refill at one point.	review	I_47G-R2_egp7ME5u_ltew	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.18	{u'hot': 1}	[]	1	[DsN2dJ6SnTEACr1qC5zpGg, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, NTQkWYICzFE2OrJLvDIKGg, L_Xi7cNe1heZd5hfQE_gQQ, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ]	Kevin	47	user	{u'funny': 8, u'useful': 46, u'cool': 10}	2011-11

For $25.50 we got a choice of a large plain cheese pizza, a full hoagie , a dozen wings and a choice of a half Galton turners tea or a 2 liter of soda. We went ahead and did half meatball and half pepperoni on the pizza, which was decent for pizza. Then, we got the Philly cheese steak, which was good, but a little light on the inside. Next, we got a dozen of the sweet and tangy wings. We liked these better than the additional dozen of mild wings we got. Lastly, we got the fires and cheese. The fries were nothing special, but just standard frozen fries with cold cheese. They forgot the ranch we ordered and they only have one phone line, which ended up taking like ten minutes to take my credit card between timing out and taking phone orders. I would give this place another chance at some point, but it was a bit underwhelming the first time around.	review	I_47G-R2_egp7ME5u_ltew	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.18	{u'hot': 1}	[]	1	[DsN2dJ6SnTEACr1qC5zpGg, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, NTQkWYICzFE2OrJLvDIKGg, L_Xi7cNe1heZd5hfQE_gQQ, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ]	Kevin	47	user	{u'funny': 8, u'useful': 46, u'cool': 10}	2011-11

Upon entering the store I was expecting to be welcomed and asked to be helped. Instead there were four ladies behind the counter staring blankly at my girlfriend and I. So, we both said hello and I gave them a lead in saying that we have never been to their bakery. Was sort of expecting one of the ladies to take the reins and make some suggestions or ask us what we are interested in or possibly even offer us a sample. Nope, instead they didn't get the hint. Eventually, we got one of them to work with us. We asked a few questions about if any of the cookies were soft, and were given us less than impressed, blah answer of no. Then we saw a little chocolate cake and asked if was like a Ho-Ho (which is what they sort of looked like) and was told that it was not like a Ho-Ho. We ended up getting a raspberry tart cookie, raisin cookie, and two of the little chocolate cakes. Price was good at less than $3 for all four items. The chocolate cakes tasted pretty similar to Ho-Hos...The raisin cookie was hard and gross. I immediately spit it out and gave the rest to our dog. The other cookie was OK. I've heard the doughnuts are good, so I'd probably be willing to give this place another shot, so long as I got something different.	review	I_47G-R2_egp7ME5u_ltew	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.18	{u'hot': 1}	[]	1	[DsN2dJ6SnTEACr1qC5zpGg, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, NTQkWYICzFE2OrJLvDIKGg, L_Xi7cNe1heZd5hfQE_gQQ, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ]	Kevin	47	user	{u'funny': 8, u'useful': 46, u'cool': 10}	2011-11

I normally go for their wings, though some of their sandwiches are pretty good too. I will say the quality of the wings can be a miss sometimes. The spicy parm particularly aren't consistent, but when they are done right, they are awesome. The wings are really only affordable on wing nights, but they are a bit pricey even on wing nights these days.

Now, I went here last night with a few people, and I will have to repeat what others have been saying recently. Immediately we noticed their menu is drastically different.  A full two sided page is missing from the menu. They have even less wing flavors (they didn't have many to begin with). The menu is actually even smaller if you pay attention, because there are actually new items on the menu. Why such drastic changes?

We started off with the bacon cheese fries, which are every bit as delicious as they normally are loaded with thick, real bacon bits; however, the portion is smaller than it used to be. I had one of the few burgers, which was pretty good as well, but a new one to me. Not sure if I would order the Kim Jong Moo again. The lady got the spicy parm wings, which were good, but could have used more parm (again hit or miss).

A friend ordered the new, we believe, ""original buffalo cauliflower"", which was barely cooked cauliflower drowning in hot sauce. It was neither deep fried or topped with blue cheese, in our opinions, as the description stated. Super pricey at $9 as well for about 10 pieces of cauliflower. Pretty dissappointing and the waiter offered no sympathy when we mentioned our dismay with them.

Finally, this place has been under renovation for the better part of this year and I wonder if it will ever be finished. Please finish the new bathrooms soon, as the current ones are pretty foul. I'll give them a 4 for now, but with recent changes and increased prices, I'm starting to think this place might become mediocre and a 3. There are still good things on the menu for sure, but the changes leave me miffed a bit."	review	I_47G-R2_egp7ME5u_ltew	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.18	{u'hot': 1}	[]	1	[DsN2dJ6SnTEACr1qC5zpGg, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, NTQkWYICzFE2OrJLvDIKGg, L_Xi7cNe1heZd5hfQE_gQQ, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ]	Kevin	47	user	{u'funny': 8, u'useful': 46, u'cool': 10}	2011-11

Customer service is always great and prices are fair. 
My most recent experience with customer service was AMAZING. So a hose burst on my hot tub. Call repair guy or try to fix it myself? I gave it a go. Took pictures of the hose and fitting and headed to the plumbing section. I showed the gentleman the picture and asked for help. He didn't have exactly the fitting for a hot tub, but gave me what he thought would work. It did! Under $3 bucks later and all was a go! Winter came and it sprung a leak in same spot. My fault and maybe lack of strength to tighten fitting and frigid temps. Back to plumbing section. Same gentleman. Gave me the advice again and bam, fixed!

B&B always asks for an email address, by I no longer get email coupons. ?? Like for years. I get them in the USPS, but why ask for email address then?

Thins I like about EnP:
1. You always know what you're getting. Standard across the board. 
2.Pies great. Baked goods great. 
3. Soup good. 
4. Who doesn't love a Smiley cookie? 
5. They are a charitable group and I think that's awesome. 

Things that make me squiggly smile. I ordered the basic breakfast smile the other day. I asked to hold the toast and potatoes and swap a fruit cup. Get the less-than-half-cup of fruit and it's sub par. Yes, winter, but isn't their ideal to use what is in season? I can still find some sort of fruit in grocery store that's decent and you're a major chain! Find a supplier. What really was disappointing was that my server up-charged me 1.99 for less-than-half-cup. Now I have worked in the past for many years. Yes, some swaps do require an additional charge, but really? I just gave you back potatoes and toast for clear fruit. She did take it off, but I'm sure she was doing what is practice. So if I would have paid for that it would have been over 10 bucks for two eggs, two pieces of bacon (which is a buck a piece on up charge on friend's sandwich) and coffee and basically three bites of fruit.

Service. I was there with a large group for a meeting. They gave us a private room and two servers took care of us. They were efficient and very accommodating. Kudos. 

Appetizers: had the crab dip and calamari. Both were good. Servers brought extra chips with the dip as they were needed. I'm always surprised that more chips are not just added to the original dish at this point. Dip was good. Calamari was done well. Preferred the shrimp cocktail Sauce with it versus the Asian type soy sauce that is served with it. 

Wedge salad with bleu cheese. Waaaaaay too much cheese and I like bleu cheese. 

I had the blackened tuna with mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies. Carrots were carrot sticks hardly cooked and dry! Green beans overdone and broccoli had seen better days. Simple green beans would have been more appetizing. 
Tuna had blackening spices but needed a better sear on it. Was not over cooked. Potatoes as expected. 
Other dishes seen--fisherman's platter. Looked a little greasy, but that's expected from me in a full fried dish. Would be nice if this was offered broiled as well. Crab cakes and filet looked okay. 

Overall I'm always underwhelmed and overcharged here. I guess with chain places you get that, but I want more from a place that charges me 25 bucks for sub-seared tuna."	review	JPPhyFE-UE453zA6K0TVgw	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	4.21	{u'funny': 5, u'plain': 9, u'writer': 14, u'note': 2, u'hot': 9, u'more': 1, u'cool': 14}	[2014, 2015]	7	[fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, kpIBCCozTB0J0d3SZJfjhw, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, 6xS41eiB_7MHNjT411-0Cg, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ, r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ, 6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA, EaygcD0k9Q4G01FAVcK4cg, yL9aMbRxHoQtcWhefPQNtQ, _mED9wnBvdELs6WCQlU17g, QQacOXfgNDSwTvJyzB1iLA, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, lAqoz5QTFxp3GDfpq0McRQ, lT980DTCnqbp0PGWBBXOzg, wCJbSEmMeZ0mAnJRQEyfCQ, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, AZCVbJat2-_AVJePjoFZyQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, RxEegiMllenlyhYgJqsTSQ, 2BYGvFAgV87LgIk4EqLtwg, 4htH8kIpBee8XS8L7Y4E3A, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA, 55akSAhRhH_cDbfXUiY-6A, OXF2mmi2UNvYBnHe7NnvOg, gCKsWAuo3m2wg_JR8H5CUw]	Molly	146	user	{u'funny': 36, u'useful': 136, u'cool': 70}	2012-06

Outdoor seating.  Great place for summertime/fall time drinks and dinner. 
Upstairs couch seating. I always like the comfy atmosphere. 

Food. Most selections are always really good. Burgers, hummus, spinach dip. They always have a good rotating menu with seasonal apps and entrees. One I love that used to be a regular and returns at times is the Rita Hayworth and the Pork Shank Redemption. Most delicious pork shank! 

Happy hour is good with deals on apps and drinks. Beware the frozen Cosmo. While quite delish, get a driver. I swear to you I had two one night and had to stay at a friend's house up the street. 


Things I don't love. 
My only disappointment as of late are the seasonal drink features and a lot of the cocktail prices. I had a black walnut Manhattan and while it was very good, it was not $12 good. Prices are never listed for the drinks and they should be. 

To end on a positive, my service has always been great here. It can get quite busy and snotty at times from the customers who feel entitled to their neighborhood and the hosts/hostesses take the brunt of that.

First...I'm a fan of new agey type places and the people that inhabit them. 

Second...the merchandise in here is pretty awesome. Candles, cards, medals, statues, love spells, books, signs, jewelry....I could go on and on. The gemstones are very reasonable and handpicked at different shows. Some of the items I think are REALLY inexpensive as compared to what I've seen in similar stores around the country and really beautiful.

Third...I love the ladies that own/run Journeys. They're always eager to help find the perfect gift for someone (or myself usually) and direct me to the right item. I never feel like the are ""selling"" but are happy for people to look and let the items find them.

Fourth...how I got here. My friends and I were discussing card/spiritual readers that we had been to in the past and this place came up. I was happy to try someone and something new and different for a reading. Love, love, love Stephanie for Akashic records. Rebecca (my usual reader from another place) for Tarot was great, too, but I don't believe she reads here anymore. 

In any sense, if you just want to peruse, look for a great gift for yourself or someone else or find an interesting read or HAVE an Interesting read you, stop in here.

Atmosphere gets an A. It is pretty cool the way the brewery and restaurant sit in a church. Out of towners I'm sure love this aspect of the restaurant. 
Food:  good. Not great. Hummus is decent. Bruschetta decent. Had the mussels most recently. Good. I've had better. Frites...eh. Run of the mill. 
Beer: I want to love the beer. I really do...but I'm always underwhelmed. I even bought two bottles at a charity auction years back and one I spilled out. I'm a craft beer lover. I like them all...stouts to wheats to sours to saisons. I'm just never totally impressed when I order a beer here. I will say it's better on tap than in a bottle.

I've done birthday dinners and a New Year's Eve about 10 years ago there. That night was great. We made reservations and asked what they could do for a party of 14. Gave us a fixed price for family style (including corking fee.) food was awesome and plentiful. 
Some Dishes I've had:
Beans and greens: simple, nicely flavored and great appetizer
Fried zucchini: picky about this but gave it a try. They used a light bread crumb, maybe a panko? It was decent. Not the best I've had, but good. 
Linguini with clam sauce: very good. Must like garlic which I do. White sauce was light and not too laden with oil/butter. 
Chicken dish with bay leaves and apples: I can't remember  the name of this dish, but it's delicious!
Other pastas on the menu I've tasted and all have been very good.

We went for brunch without reservations. This gave us seats in the Saloon which I actually like better. A little more intimate setting and I think I was able to hear a little better because of the wide open space in the dining area. We didn't wait more than 20 min to be seated. You may want to make a reservation. 

Had a Bloody Mary at the bar first. I wish I would have asked for a drink menu as they had a few different variations on the Bloody Mary. All in all it was a good traditional version. Nice beer selection and extensive liquor and wine selection. 

The brunch had everything. Everything. Price fairly at $27 it offered hot breakfast items: eggs, omelettes to order, bacon, sausage, potatoes, Mac n cheese, waffles to order with bananas foster, you name it. They have homemade donuts, too. 

Cold bar with shrimp, mussels, assorted salads and salmon 10 different ways. My favorite which was there 22 years ago....smoke blue fish pate. This is sooooo good. I could have just had the cold bar and dessert.

My mom and I got a waffle with bananas foster /ice cream for dessert...and then of course picked up a sticky bun and a couple truffles, too for sharing. My dad loved the truffles! They were delish!

The decor--stained glass is remarkable. I know there's a greater history with the windows being painted, but I don't know all the correct details. In any sense, just looking at the place is beautiful.

What I feel like is a real surprise are the pepperoni rolls. Really good! Soft pretzel is eh...fresh out of the freezer.

Great beer selection and their brews are always pretty good. I usually try to drink one of the seasonal ones they are brewing.

ALWAYS busy. ALWAYS. It's crowded and loud, but I expect that in there. Usually have good service as well.

Joe was very polite and friendly as soon as I met him, as was his shop assistant. I needed a CV joint installed as well as a new transmission mount. Joe was nice enough to estimate a fair price to install both, he honored that price, was fast, very friendly, and treated me like he knew me for years. It's a great neighborhood shop and Joe is a real nice guy who could have easily raked me over the coals, but he didn't. I know quite a bit about cars, and everything he told me was true.

Tram's has, arguably (though it might not be much of an argument), some of the best tasting food in Pittsburgh, period.  An instant bonus star for being extremely vegetarian friendly.  

My date and I split tofu spring rolls which were fresh, delicious and went well with the peanut based sauce provided.  For the main course I had tofu vermicelli which was by far the best item of food I've had since I've moved to this city.  With generous amounts of tofu, vermicelli and whatever coconut based heavenly sauce they put in it, it's hard not to finish an entire bowl.  Throw in some Sriracha and garlic hot sauce and It's almost too good to be true.   For desert we split an order of ""banana cake,"" which sounds kind of stupid, but is actually incredible.  I have no idea what they put in it--maybe a rice based cake, with some beans cooked in, topped with coconut banana cream with sesame seed garnishing?  Really though, who cares?  You just accept it for what it is and eat because it's delicious.

All of this food for two people with prompt service for $25.  How could you not give this place 5 stars?  A big shout out to Tram too.  I think he's the dude with with amputated arm. He's the man.

It's a nice little cozy environment that just has a comforting feel to it.  Plenty of flat screen TVs to catch the big game, though not sure what their channel options are for out of town games.  I'd have to go back to investigate.  Otherwise, the service was solid, the drink menu was decent, and the food was good.  I had the nachos which were pretty average to slightly above average in nature.  The guacamole was actually good though.  Nothing to write home about, but decent enough to enjoy.

The first time I had food from here was when I was working and a  couple of co-workers wanted Thai.  It's nice that we have a place so convenient to our hospital.  Unfortunately during that time, I had to wait an extra 20 minutes past the estimated pick-up time for our order before receiving the food.  The order was received correctly, however my tofu pad thai just tasted a bit bland.  Not sure they got the sauce right or something.  It's not that it wasn't edible, it just wasn't very tasty.  Kind of meh, if you will.

Fast forward 3 weeks later when my co-workers and I went out to eat at the restaurant this time around.  The service was decent and the food was fantastic.  I had the spicy noodles which was a great mix of thick noodles, veggies and tofu.  Just a couple of critiques:  I think it's stupid that they charge you $1 extra per person for BYOB.  Also, their policy which states no separate checks for parties of 5 or more, is kind of annoying.  Otherwise, I'd consider eating here if you're in the area.  Though it is worth nothing a far superior Thai restaurant, Pusadee's Garden, is right up the street."	review	fhNxoMwwTipzjO8A9LFe8Q	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.92	{u'funny': 2, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 12, u'writer': 6, u'note': 3, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 8, u'more': 1, u'cool': 11}	[2012, 2013, 2014]	5	[-QjeoLnIeKStNfGIq5KGDw, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, scIDar9VGDMcTOHbem37pg, tRiiWXEjMg_EKlHWGO4HSg, qObeTrDHdUwvqsi4Ojlg9Q, v3nPv8G4dV6y-LNesb6Mug, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, IGvU12Ucglrs0a4BG5aAwA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, Ykl1iVyACYGwzk9DCE0CJA, cZuTvtn19VXAGer-giejxA, JWtFuKaFXn_l5h-qKZWZuQ, lBCFj5onphRSCmvM083Bjw, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, khC_OcpNIs6zsfPHaAPchQ, HkYiQtTxRc8NRMyGizgDlA, tqh64xJvBdxX6ltR_JYhnA, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 39AweEGLrDbGXNAJhAJt7A, bYHYrDEjj5vwoa4U55RSNg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ]	Kavi	180	user	{u'funny': 75, u'useful': 220, u'cool': 85}	2012-04
68	sxeuOMBRllOHXJTaUlI9kQ	2012-12-15	iw14g7Np5hE_SP5GJfd9Xg	3	Still sticking with my original rating.  Just had dinner here last night.  The decor is great with the new remodel and all, and the food is still solid.  I give it 3 stars because I find it to be good/serviceable Thai food, but certainly not the best in the city.  I had the eggplant dish, which was hot, fresh and tasty, but what disappointed me was the lack of requested spice (level 9).  When I ask for something to be spicy, make it spicy.  Simple request, no?  Nevertheless, I still recommend this restaurant because the quality is good, the service is good and price is right.  A great spot in the Bloomfield neighborhood for sure.	review	fhNxoMwwTipzjO8A9LFe8Q	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 1}	3.92	{u'funny': 2, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 12, u'writer': 6, u'note': 3, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 8, u'more': 1, u'cool': 11}	[2012, 2013, 2014]	5	[-QjeoLnIeKStNfGIq5KGDw, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, scIDar9VGDMcTOHbem37pg, tRiiWXEjMg_EKlHWGO4HSg, qObeTrDHdUwvqsi4Ojlg9Q, v3nPv8G4dV6y-LNesb6Mug, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, IGvU12Ucglrs0a4BG5aAwA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, Ykl1iVyACYGwzk9DCE0CJA, cZuTvtn19VXAGer-giejxA, JWtFuKaFXn_l5h-qKZWZuQ, lBCFj5onphRSCmvM083Bjw, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, khC_OcpNIs6zsfPHaAPchQ, HkYiQtTxRc8NRMyGizgDlA, tqh64xJvBdxX6ltR_JYhnA, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 39AweEGLrDbGXNAJhAJt7A, bYHYrDEjj5vwoa4U55RSNg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ]	Kavi	180	user	{u'funny': 75, u'useful': 220, u'cool': 85}	2012-04

The first time was for a fancy-pants dinner in which the upstairs portion of the restaurant was reserved and the guests were privileged enough to indulge in unlimited drinks and a very elaborate 5 course meal.  Soba is very much ""Asian-Fusion"" in its cuisine, and it pulls it off quite well.  As a vegetarian, there are plenty of options for me to choose from.  Some of the dishes that stand out to me include the tofu appetizer and the vegetable curry entree.

The second time I visited here, I sat by the bar, which is dimly lit, relatively quiet, but gives off this cool sort of vibe.  I love it.  We had a great time.  Service was fantastic. 

My critiques would be 1.) a tad bit pricier than what I would like to pay and 2.) could up the ante on the spice level just a tad.

Otherwise, I highly recommend this place.

Located in the heart of Shadyside, above Pamela's, who would ever expect a quaint little cafe serving up some surprisingly delicious and affordable Peruvian dishes?  Come over here to enjoy a nice, quick and incredibly tasty meal.  Peruvian food is fantastic because there are a lot of vegetarian options, which make me incredibly happy.  We really enjoyed the vegetarian fritata: eggs, avacado, pepper, onions served with a side of rice and an incredibly tasty salad.  Even better, the beautifully crafted habanero sauce they brought out (without us requesting this, might I add), was absolutely perfect.  

Service was great.  The atmosphere was pretty nice: lots of Peruvian art-work, the lighting was a bit too bright for my tastes, but hey I'm being picky at this point.  This is definitely a cafe and not what you'd consider fine-dining.  But for what it is, it's exceptional.  The price is great too: our meal for 2 topped out at around $25?  That's exceptional, especially for the quantity and quality of food.

Crepes galore.  We had the nutella with chocolate and the veggie crepe with eggs.  Both items were fantastic.  Since we weren't quite feeling the darky basementy vibe on an otherwise gorgeous spring day, we sat outside the restaurant on one of their tables, which was definitely a nice touch to the restaurant.  The service for the most part was good: I was kind of annoyed by how slow it takes to order and cook these dishes.  I noticed that there are only 2 stations to make the crepes.  They'd certainly benefit from an expansion.  Lines get long, wait time can be significant (prob had a 30-40 min lag from when we stepped into the building to when we finally got served), but it's worth it if you have the time.

It's a church, but they're brewin' brews at the altar.  Kind of messed up, sort of.  Though, let's not lie, you know it's pretty cool.

The food that I had was good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  We had the feta cheese/spinach pizza which had a generous amount of vegetables and crust that was just a tad bit undercooked for my liking, but still decently tasty.  The appetizer (perogies) and desert (blueberry ice cream and chocolate mousse) were all excellent.  

I'm giving this place three stars, because while I think it's solid, I don't think it's all that it's cracked up to be.  The beer selection doesn't look all that extensive, though I suppose you'd like it if you're big into craft brews.  The food is somewhat pricey and from what I had, I could think of a few other places where I'd rather eat for the price I'm paying.

What I don't think about is a small little restaurant with upscale food and a laid-back vibe.  This place totally flies under the radar, and it definitely this aspect that makes me like this place so much.  Everything you'll enjoy about this place is completely unexpected (or maybe less so now that I'm telling you!).  

When you walk in, you'll notice a small cafe vibe with this surprisingly European like feel: 10 or so small tables are located in the back.  The decoration is somewhat nondescript (we sat next to a refrigerator proudly displaying the ""Coke"" logo).  What is cool is the fact that the food is literally prepared next to you behind this counter.   The service is among the best I have experienced in this city.  The hallmark of a good waiter is one who anticipates your needs.  For instance, on Valentine's day when I went, I ordered a small cup of soup, and the server was insightful enough to bring out two spoons.  I know, a little detail, but one that matters and makes my experience that much better.

Speaking of the food: out of this world.  The menu options are somewhat limited, but I can tell they must change, as do their specials.  There will be a vegetarian option waiting for you.  We started our meal out with bruschetta that came with creamy cheese-spinach sauce with plenty of cubed-seasoned tomatoes: so rich, so creamy, so so good.  The bruchetta was also crisp and warm-simply perfect.  The mushroom soup we shared was full of 4 different types of musrhooms: oyster, shitake, portobello and porcini.  My entree was the eggplant dish: baked eggplant with this sweet pepper sauce, some cheese and...really, I don't know what else but other than the fact it left this little ting in my mouth which when combined with the sweetness of the sauce made for an incredible experience.  My girlfriend enjoyed her salmon dish.  We capped off the meal with chocolate mousse which was simply decadent.  

Several other things to note prior to dining here.  1.) Make reservations and make them in advance.  2.) Don't come here expecting full privacy.  Tables are jam packed next to each other.  We definitely had a neighboring couple interrupt us in our conversation since they over-heard something we were talking about that must have appealed them.  Luckily for us, this interaction proved to be quite pleasant and added to our experience, but just a heads up for the rest of you..3.) Cash only, so go to the ATM.  3 course meal for 2 will run you around $80, which certainly isn't bad given the high quality of the food and 4.) BYOB so definitely bring something to complement the fantastic flavor of the food that you are about to enjoy!"	review	fhNxoMwwTipzjO8A9LFe8Q	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 7, u'cool': 3}	3.92	{u'funny': 2, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 12, u'writer': 6, u'note': 3, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 8, u'more': 1, u'cool': 11}	[2012, 2013, 2014]	5	[-QjeoLnIeKStNfGIq5KGDw, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, scIDar9VGDMcTOHbem37pg, tRiiWXEjMg_EKlHWGO4HSg, qObeTrDHdUwvqsi4Ojlg9Q, v3nPv8G4dV6y-LNesb6Mug, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, IGvU12Ucglrs0a4BG5aAwA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, Ykl1iVyACYGwzk9DCE0CJA, cZuTvtn19VXAGer-giejxA, JWtFuKaFXn_l5h-qKZWZuQ, lBCFj5onphRSCmvM083Bjw, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, khC_OcpNIs6zsfPHaAPchQ, HkYiQtTxRc8NRMyGizgDlA, tqh64xJvBdxX6ltR_JYhnA, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 39AweEGLrDbGXNAJhAJt7A, bYHYrDEjj5vwoa4U55RSNg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ]	Kavi	180	user	{u'funny': 75, u'useful': 220, u'cool': 85}	2012-04

It just so happens to be the home of the Pittsburgh Browns Backers.  Last Thursday, I found my way to the second floor where I was greeted by a group of Cleveland transplants such as myself.  We had a fantastic time watching our team play.  And while the Browns lost, as expected, I had a great time.  The service at the bar was excellent: friendly and prompt.  The nachos were both cheap and quite stellar.  Guacamole would have been nice, but nevertheless, the cheese was quite sharp and packed a nice little zing.  Furthermore, the price cannot be beat.  Is this a place to have a romantic dinner with your SO?  Of course not.  But if you're looking for a good, perhaps sloppy time, then sure.

The food comes out fast, is fresh, quite delicious, and will leave you extremely satisfied.  You certainly cannot go wrong with some Hummus or the Falafel Rolled.

Maybe you also feel like finishing it off with some liquid sugar, that is carbonated?  If so, look no further than Italian Village Pizza's amazing $5 and change deal which consists of two NY style cheese pizza (can add toppings for marginal fee) and a fountain drink.  The pizza is well cooked, is tasty and hot, with decent crust.  Add some banana peppers to that thing and you're rollin'.  Like I said, good but not special.  Great value.

Now for the actual food: upscale bar food that is good, but nothing to write home about. My meal included nachos as an appetizer and Mac&Cheese for the entree.    Nachos were the standard gringo fare that is typical of nacho dishes in this part of the country: salty chips, bland salsa and blah guac.  The Mac and cheese, however, was heavenly.  

Service for our large group was on point.  The price was a bit too steep for my tastes given the quantity and quality of food I sampled.

Let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she said I need to indulge their interests. Even if they suck. 

Buffalo Blues is like a Hooters, except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking. The service is horrendous and the food may be better at Hooters.  The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board.

My friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly I don't get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.  They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo.  

I chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice.  It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.

I paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave.

As for the bluesgrass jam night I can't really recommend it. I was worried that it would be a bunch of hipsters standing in a circle pretending to be the Lumineers, and it was.

We split a bowl of the wedding soup with was easily the best version that I have ever had. The escarole really makes it.  I had the chicken parmesan dinner.

The calzone is at Big Jim's is ridiculous.  It needs to come with a warning other than that it takes 45 minutes.  I am not kidding these calzones could double as tomatoey warming blankets for italian newborns.  My wife and I couldn't come close to finish this.

As for the service, I would like to call it, Pittsburgh friendly. Meaning that in any other city you would assume your server was rude and incompetent but in Pittsburgh it is normal.  Just now what you want before your server gets there.

I had somewhat high hopes because so many people rave about it, but as I have learned, people in Pittsburgh don't really know food.

We ordered two small pizzas. 1 Pepperoni and 1 sausage and mushroom.  
Let's start with the pepperoni.  The pepperoni had a decent flavor and the cheese wasn't bad but overall the pizza lacked flavor. 

As for the sausage and mushroom, what a mess.  The sausage was hands down disgusting.  It tasted like bob evans breakfast sausage that had been boiled. No flavor  or texture.  The mushrooms were slimy and gross straight out of a can.

My biggest complaints lie in the sauce and construction.  The sauce was bland and flavorless.  No acidic pop or sweetness to speak of.  Also both pizzas were impossible to eat.  All of the toppings slid off because of the moronic sauce, meat. cheese construction.  Pizza is a handheld event. If you have to use a fork, someone screwed up.

Is it a modern fish market? Is it a grocery store?  I would just like Wholey's to choose an identity and strive to be great at it.  

I was always taught that a good fish market shouldn't smell fishy. Too many times Wholey's smells like the inside of my tackle box. The fish selection at Wholey's is greater than your normal supermarket but not what I would expect from a top notch fish market. I am not a big fan of all of their processed frozen fish product.  Also the the quality to price ratio seems to be a little off.  With that said there are deals to be had if you pay attention.  My other issue is with Wholey's as a full service fish monger.  Every time I have had a question about a type of fish the staff had seemed pretty ignorant.  I would put them at the level of a giant eagle employee but lower than the monger at Whole Foods.  I also  take issue with Wholey's charging for scaling or even taking the fins and tail off of a fish.  This has been complimentary at any real fish monger that I have ever been to.

This weekend I purchased 2 pounds of the ocean perch filets that were on sale thinking that they would be a quick ingredient for a dinner party that I was hosting. Today, when I went to pull them out, I found to my dismay, that they were poorly butchered.  Every filet had large portions that had not been scaled completely and the filets had bones (not pin bones) hanging off the bottom. This added over an hour to my prep time and left me quite unsatisfied. If I had wanted to take the time to break a fish down I would have purchased whole fish from the start.  Needless to say I expected more from one of Pittsburgh's premier fish mongers. I also emailed Wholey's and have still not received a response.  

Will I go back? Probably. But only because they are the only place that I can pork belly that is not frozen  Just be aware that there are better fish mongers in Pittsburgh and even in the Strip."	review	-6rEfobYjMxpUWLNxszaxQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.28	{u'note': 1, u'plain': 1, u'cool': 3}	[]	1	[nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, ukf5AhPo3dJhEWB2km-Stw, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ]	Andrew	29	user	{u'funny': 18, u'useful': 61, u'cool': 11}	2012-11

It is cash only, and they sell the last bucket at 8, despite having lights.  And if you finish even a minute after 8, don't plan on getting a drink.  The vending machines are sold out (of course) and they sell drinks inside, but close the drawers at 8 on the dot.  There are weeds grown all over the place.  I noticed some sort of batting cage, but it looks like those are out of order as well.  Someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be.	review	KZuaJtFindQM9x2ZoMBxcQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	1.0	{}	[]	0	[]	Anonymous	2	user	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	2013-07

It's a fairly big range - if you are familiar with Scally's in Moon, it seems like it has almost as many tees, though its not nearly as nice a facility. 

The guys in the pro shop were two of the friendlier guys I've come across at ranges or at courses. Yards were indeed marked and there are some targets to aim for, and even some hazards to aim away from. 

A big red flag to me was the extra charge ($3) to hit off the grass. I am no range expert, but this is the 4th one I've been to and the first I've seen of that sort of nickel and diming....

Price for the golf balls was reasonable and I do plan to be back every week until they close up in October for the season. Hopefully, since its for sale, it will reopen as a golf facility again."	review	H9E5VejGEsRhwcbOMFknmQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	4.29	{u'hot': 1}	[]	0	[]	Pierce	7	user	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 5, u'cool': 1}	2013-08

Previous reviewers are correct - if you are used to the idea of a coffee shop that the local and national chains have given us, there really isn't room for that there.

The entire range appears to be turf, which may or many not help your game, but it looks really nice.  The tee boxes look state of the art and the club house looks like something you'll see on a newer course.

Their prices are decent to stay and their rooms are very nice. You don't get all the glitter and glitz that you would like some of the other fancy and classy hotels on the strip but this hotel is still great for a vacation for families that can't stay away from the casinos and still want to have fun for the family. The pool is nice and the ride will keep the kids entertained.

The hotel is immaculate and very well maintained. This hotel will make you feel like you are back in Venice, Italy. You must ride the gondola which will give you a glimpse of how true Italians live. Their rooms are very spacious and clean.  You are close to the Palazzo Hotel also so in the casino you might get a little confused once your walking all through it. Plenty of restaurants to enjoy and shopping all around so this is a great place to stay i highly recommend it.	review	JbAeIYc89Sk8SWmrBCJs9g	{u'funny': 4, u'useful': 5, u'cool': 5}	3.74	{u'profile': 25, u'funny': 98, u'cute': 6, u'plain': 468, u'writer': 106, u'list': 4, u'note': 235, u'photos': 32, u'hot': 172, u'more': 26, u'cool': 340}	[]	39	[4U9kSBLuBDU391x6bxU-YA, 8J4IIYcqBlFch8T90N923A, xafscyoSZPnchPkzGyDAWw, Rir-YRPPClKXDFQbc3BsVw, ui9t1cVFQ7RJOUQskdkh3A, WGf64PeXIZtdoqkBj0-_zA, BMWpDBMgkWr6kf__LNXEQw, 1q5gY-FkMunyaFRq6zQP2A, SyVS1ZskPHq728XwIZYpjQ, z9QVdtpdSEmKAnM2PhJU9w, Mg0G8_Wa_FoNQO3Kv7RDNw, G5PsRwFSjF4Sql7ME0ENsw, qbfQRHLvZk5WSkKY0l_lMw, e-t3dRzH9bmsanmhYgSiVQ, OMB8Y_DOaB21vCXa-cruwg, lRCgAQwFem1WueNkidzWvA, 52hYzmoL4yUFyc9Ct1Zukg, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, jNYnzoRhUHo2-ORtCPz5VA, XTn5Rx1r8pfaHLt8sXqdWQ, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, BNPv22qbGw7cmmIzlngKbw, zV7uC4ejOHw_87HU-dVPXw, llAtgO8Q4jJuU7NDU7mlWQ, 68Ci9UgVIVEiCGXy05loLw, 8S-UrKLKRsJhv6mfpCV7lQ, kzBwHWrKuKbY1TBpnGma9A, d-T5TghtiYD_7rfk9Px-TA, em7RhfSHxGW19L7b2bYtmw, YwcacxA7WCB9fryDHDxF8w, qWLezzHxOXN-GQdInixZzw, BJUXMLNyQKjQq57BDWy1Ow, DzVKlwlnqwSSiGGzLmAp_g, 66eDe47cNYFNOW_8El0W6g, SjocZ3uwUAKl-vBZ0UYmuw, ac-LWMXfGE0ZMChLhYqnnA, kGgAARL2UmvCcTRfiscjug, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, rX_t4oJNwMTLMleZ7s4ztA, vVdCwxZgDtL9XRHRnHaIKw, FOgD-n23sDTEm03vtIp1QQ, yPreZPyfWda3BlFH0xCKKg, EhcZKrQJIS226xdm_qJ71w, exZB-WQpHI2woqzHLdyE1Q, 1KfEax7Wn5pc30cG4CwYdw, jqiDWycSAWIhSHIfN_PjAw, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, WfhACQmaXTaSdtvFPD7Kwg, bjkrBrQY3bIdskBCfsIaxQ, qWV1sSKn53BmghpP56IIfA, oTEUNAHIWYaNvJGvo54aCw, 9eQkqRBSJvpedQNz_hhY3A, Exg4LdqBrB0dB6jmSsp7AQ, IO70fCrDS1GlrEDkAvsKYg, 9h54-TfZ53Ag7d9duGrGtA, NOgUDhql_0TXIS3SOdvQfg, mAuBHENS_DeFCQqrJC_UxA, SeE7Om9dLCv6LmiXOkjUMg, kuEKOd7JEnDun43SUsjJ7w, 2rlBbFPHyZjXSFSE8r551w, I01EeNgRX-bqd0tbfL44vQ, ULOPLvLghKZrfo3PhwbPAQ, y9NvtHUzizvWFYSZ5FV5_g, xaEtXJM62xy-jdGyevR7VQ, 8J4z23YzBtyMY6JW206VGQ, sD2FwbZGcSav2NVNQwkY1Q, fREQimvpmtkHn5XwhbyB4A, hCi6pb08OEpXMPb69sntAQ, bTgZZ03AJEs7t2EFLiMxzw, iP1yKSifG4v_UMYvLts_gg, b7nQk97uM0feVnax851_5Q, -ANkfLbDf8aiBQ7vywIL6w, 5uwVhPPaz5VHfboekqKsug, Nu0oythh2v7FSfJb30d12g, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, 9bkeCCr28lE7vxg1GvWsiw, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, b5AvOyryK7RueqFi9Ui3cw, y8ZCNq8HSGDSx7Vm-NYEOw, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, NGaa4JBPXl8GzdDWWbxb7Q, s8Om9oHMk8xb_psgxTNeRA, zRiz9k2brNAW-AgM_TLk6Q, C6e99lRD0tVg6eSBLSnd_w, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, NhXOaROBjlU-IuQrmWrQYQ, q9XgOylNsSbqZqF_SO3-OQ, MuNDDc8YGJGSIzDVVldxtg, nHpARjKUASllWzp-o5-Mlg, aYpO4xX9yWRGfF09Co4SXw, p24ECnwNOfdQMs6SDtZiiA, nFO4MFFynxIiO1mOY9W8sQ, mKqXFHS3B-eD61mE_-6cWA, knWADdyhOIQk5S1U5RtBew, 0bNXP9quoJEgyVZu9ipGgQ, 7xyR5Pg99uMaO_QM-2yneQ, sdTdf5zwsPGDw4vBnKks-w, twtLAtv2o53z0WVz_2jQmw, fbptXENl0deC0-TY_VXL8w, ID0f8slG5-Ch9TlFDrFK1Q, ...]	Leticia	718	user	{u'funny': 1736, u'useful': 2890, u'cool': 2375}	2011-02

You might say, ""I've never heard of Rock Bottom, there's no way that they are a chain restaurant."" Beer? Apps? Bros? Sounds like a good time, but be careful or you'll end up on the rock bottom.

After a 30 minute wait staring at half of an empty restaurant with the usual goofy decor you would find at a Buffalo Wild Wings, we were finally seated. We could feel the tension from other diners that something wasn't right. The manger was running around apologetically and the food was casually sunbathing under the heat lamps. We immediately ordered a few apps but just like GOT, and now our watch begins.

We waited and waited to finally receive the saddest, tiniest plates of food with bloated chain restaurant prices. The food was uninspired, tired, and ordinary. The only reason why I am giving them 2 stars is because of the extremely gracious and apologetic wait staff who took off 20% of our meal due to the terrible service. 

So if you have decided to take a seat at Rock Bottom, take comfort in knowing that even the staff seems to know your pain."	review	l_szjd-ken3ma6oHDkTYXg	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 0}	3.72	{u'funny': 4, u'plain': 5, u'writer': 8, u'note': 2, u'photos': 2, u'hot': 9, u'cool': 7, u'more': 4}	[2015]	5	[D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, FP79xn8H2XXnMksRuP5l6A, -LvIrLolxl9-fg8zL4tfWw, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, uqYy4jSemEzbBfcIwkQ7iA, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 4BWGVJEqqOnihPxnZbuEzQ, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, qvafrUlgfjm6kc8Zk5R8jQ, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ, 3jtMnkVlCp-mvKItBgClTA, r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ, J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA, 6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA, GeK2XiAoWB11fV_xOk3vpA, kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA, uDIecT9tlTj1XIeqoyZUyg, _BV9_YrP3sQlNVzaJo2z_w, 0P58MD0FRVI6pTVKUpd7YA, ZqKg4O7EXci7SR_UUS2J_g, 68vjXoLMogT5p1jb8enlVQ, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, oM6CtEG2tK-4-nPVpimiFg, wCJbSEmMeZ0mAnJRQEyfCQ, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, 9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ, 4tzuxIVry4xkOR9vbpgjrw, xpvpJB3DArM9zhb10Z1rvg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, Ui3-BecgGjI63ZUU7xQF9A, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, wJ-1GuXSIbM-BBQ3JOAgAw, Pe6o1SR3T98ONB_SXaHd6Q, fBdl02j2Yp8glZ_8woQzoA, lMFk4RqW4tNe-BLLxhV-fA, 3YBDLyLDwNv4ESeBhHYuBQ, 4e9RIP5fkM7kR2Eu9IlGFg, xHDuNWPNO_2R2nlQ4w10BA, YfiHkTUuvRVDGMkyi65pOg, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, 5_GNc6DHiOOSH47ZjmOG_Q, P1TbITsJVHIgIs5ikwv_Dw, VRB9nzZnYWB6WETk_QfIEQ, 4htH8kIpBee8XS8L7Y4E3A, uSm3JH4lM2HwT85HXRCKTg, WGXfllGHz1rnXbVLB8pTkg, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, NH8aEIKCSO_xtp54zrMoTg, by25xSgP6EbR8UbokLIsjw, OXF2mmi2UNvYBnHe7NnvOg, ByOyaQ8vLipqYDSoSW-wNA]	Casey	107	user	{u'funny': 49, u'useful': 202, u'cool': 141}	2011-03

They have a wide selection of old doors and windows that always seem to be lined up in the hallways. There is a back room that seems to always have every part of an old school. At the opposite end, all sorts of bobbles and finds.

Behind the counter you can find antique doorknobs and such. On one visit there was a giant box of leftover tiles, which were all beautiful that I turned into accent coasters!

Oh Page's, How I love thee...
With your swirled frozen peaks
And sundaes covered in rainbow jimmies,
Leaves me smiling, cheek to cheek.

Page's has been a regular family outing as far back as I can remember and clearly the popularity doesn't stop with just my family. From opening day to closing you will find people willing to line up around the block to get their ice cream fix.

No other ice cream location in Pittsburgh even comes close to rivaling this outstanding soft serve experience. Our usual order consists of the basics: swirled soft serve (cup or cone) dipped in crunches or jimmies.

Not only do they have soft serve but also a wide variety of insane sundae creations and other novelties. And don't forget about the shaved ice - which comes in basically ever flavor you could imagine.

Visiting Page's isn't just about ice cream, it's about making a pilgrimage to quite possibly the city's signature ice cream experience."	review	l_szjd-ken3ma6oHDkTYXg	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.72	{u'funny': 4, u'plain': 5, u'writer': 8, u'note': 2, u'photos': 2, u'hot': 9, u'cool': 7, u'more': 4}	[2015]	5	[D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, FP79xn8H2XXnMksRuP5l6A, -LvIrLolxl9-fg8zL4tfWw, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, uqYy4jSemEzbBfcIwkQ7iA, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 4BWGVJEqqOnihPxnZbuEzQ, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, qvafrUlgfjm6kc8Zk5R8jQ, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ, 3jtMnkVlCp-mvKItBgClTA, r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ, J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA, 6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA, GeK2XiAoWB11fV_xOk3vpA, kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA, uDIecT9tlTj1XIeqoyZUyg, _BV9_YrP3sQlNVzaJo2z_w, 0P58MD0FRVI6pTVKUpd7YA, ZqKg4O7EXci7SR_UUS2J_g, 68vjXoLMogT5p1jb8enlVQ, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, oM6CtEG2tK-4-nPVpimiFg, wCJbSEmMeZ0mAnJRQEyfCQ, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, 9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ, 4tzuxIVry4xkOR9vbpgjrw, xpvpJB3DArM9zhb10Z1rvg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, Ui3-BecgGjI63ZUU7xQF9A, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, wJ-1GuXSIbM-BBQ3JOAgAw, Pe6o1SR3T98ONB_SXaHd6Q, fBdl02j2Yp8glZ_8woQzoA, lMFk4RqW4tNe-BLLxhV-fA, 3YBDLyLDwNv4ESeBhHYuBQ, 4e9RIP5fkM7kR2Eu9IlGFg, xHDuNWPNO_2R2nlQ4w10BA, YfiHkTUuvRVDGMkyi65pOg, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, 5_GNc6DHiOOSH47ZjmOG_Q, P1TbITsJVHIgIs5ikwv_Dw, VRB9nzZnYWB6WETk_QfIEQ, 4htH8kIpBee8XS8L7Y4E3A, uSm3JH4lM2HwT85HXRCKTg, WGXfllGHz1rnXbVLB8pTkg, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, NH8aEIKCSO_xtp54zrMoTg, by25xSgP6EbR8UbokLIsjw, OXF2mmi2UNvYBnHe7NnvOg, ByOyaQ8vLipqYDSoSW-wNA]	Casey	107	user	{u'funny': 49, u'useful': 202, u'cool': 141}	2011-03

The location itself was extremely clean. That might seem weird as a focal point but I have been to so many locations with dirty tables and other remnants all over the floor. This place was spic and span, bathroom included!

The table space area isn't very large but still has a variety of tables to hold a small meeting or work on your laptop.

Looking through past reviews, many talk about the Almond Torte and various other items, but I've happened to visit around holidays or busy mornings when my goal is to get in and out...leading me to try other seemingly less-hyped items. And boy have they been a great choice!

On my first visit it was Easter and I wanted to bring a treat for the family. The staff member who helped me suggested the cinnamon bread. It was probably one of the best decisions I've ever made. Not only was the bread fresh, but the cinnamon sugar was throughout the entire bread. There wasn't one piece, or complaint, from anyone about it lacking flavor (as cinnamon breads can sometimes be as you get to the middle of the loaf). As the holiday went on, many family members were grabbing it instead of a cookie or other treats around. I did also grab a few ""Almond Torte Bites"" instead of the full torte to give it a try as well. Even though they are good, they are VERY sweet and not what my tastebuds are looking for. I was very glad to have gotten the bites instead of the larger cake itself.

Most importantly, the staff was super helpful, patient, and attentive even though the store was in full swing, with a line basically out the door.

My most recent visit was today for #nationaldonutday! There are a lot of options, but there is something about the traditional glazed donut that takes the cake. I don't remember the last time I had a truly good homemade donut like this - it literally melted in my mouth. There's also something nostalgic about it that makes you feel like you're reliving a moment in your grandma's kitchen. It's something that's going to keep me coming back for a Saturday morning treat with my coffee!"	review	l_szjd-ken3ma6oHDkTYXg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.72	{u'funny': 4, u'plain': 5, u'writer': 8, u'note': 2, u'photos': 2, u'hot': 9, u'cool': 7, u'more': 4}	[2015]	5	[D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, FP79xn8H2XXnMksRuP5l6A, -LvIrLolxl9-fg8zL4tfWw, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, uqYy4jSemEzbBfcIwkQ7iA, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 4BWGVJEqqOnihPxnZbuEzQ, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, qvafrUlgfjm6kc8Zk5R8jQ, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ, 3jtMnkVlCp-mvKItBgClTA, r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ, J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA, 6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA, GeK2XiAoWB11fV_xOk3vpA, kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA, uDIecT9tlTj1XIeqoyZUyg, _BV9_YrP3sQlNVzaJo2z_w, 0P58MD0FRVI6pTVKUpd7YA, ZqKg4O7EXci7SR_UUS2J_g, 68vjXoLMogT5p1jb8enlVQ, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, oM6CtEG2tK-4-nPVpimiFg, wCJbSEmMeZ0mAnJRQEyfCQ, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, 9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ, 4tzuxIVry4xkOR9vbpgjrw, xpvpJB3DArM9zhb10Z1rvg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, Ui3-BecgGjI63ZUU7xQF9A, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, wJ-1GuXSIbM-BBQ3JOAgAw, Pe6o1SR3T98ONB_SXaHd6Q, fBdl02j2Yp8glZ_8woQzoA, lMFk4RqW4tNe-BLLxhV-fA, 3YBDLyLDwNv4ESeBhHYuBQ, 4e9RIP5fkM7kR2Eu9IlGFg, xHDuNWPNO_2R2nlQ4w10BA, YfiHkTUuvRVDGMkyi65pOg, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, 5_GNc6DHiOOSH47ZjmOG_Q, P1TbITsJVHIgIs5ikwv_Dw, VRB9nzZnYWB6WETk_QfIEQ, 4htH8kIpBee8XS8L7Y4E3A, uSm3JH4lM2HwT85HXRCKTg, WGXfllGHz1rnXbVLB8pTkg, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, NH8aEIKCSO_xtp54zrMoTg, by25xSgP6EbR8UbokLIsjw, OXF2mmi2UNvYBnHe7NnvOg, ByOyaQ8vLipqYDSoSW-wNA]	Casey	107	user	{u'funny': 49, u'useful': 202, u'cool': 141}	2011-03

This awesome Italian, family-owned bakery has always been a go-to for my family. My favorite thing growing up was driving past late at night to smell the freshly baking bread.

Inside everything is fresh and authentic. Not only are there a variety of baked goods at the bakery and deli counters, but there are fridges full of different items like pizza crusts to make your own. And you've come to the right place because you can get the crust, the fresh mozzarella, and toppings - plus the cannoli for dessert!

There are also other specialty items that they carry on the shelves in the store as well such as olive oils, pastas, and sauces.

I don't go here all the time because it seems a little pricey compared to a normal grocery run, but the quality is absolutely there and more than worth it!

I'm not sure if there's anything in particular that Armstrong's is doing out of the ordinary, but their food makes me feel like I'm a part of their big family. The food is primarily Italian and has a lot of heart. The portions you get for any dish are always more than enough to take home for leftovers.

During my last visit I ordered the chicken salad and my boyfriend got a calzone. I chose ranch as my dressing- I don't know what they put in it but it is the best ranch I've had hands down. My salad came with some garlic toast, was full of veggies and chicken, and was also ""Pittsburgh-ized"" and included fries. The calzone was literally gigantic and had as big of a flavor.

After wanting to pick something quick up for dinner one evening, we stopped into Frisch's and placed an order fro take out. After going back and forth between the deli counter and the cafeteria-style line, we finally figured out where we needed to order since the staff seemed confused themselves.

While waiting, we checked out the deli counter, which they have seriously cut back on. The food in there didn't look too fresh. I had initially wanted to get some sides, but changed my mind after seeing what was there.

We ordered chicken and the broasted potatoes. The chicken took 40+ minutes to cook and when we got home we realized that almost every piece was a wing versus a breast piece. The potatoes were generally bland. The meal also came with cole slaw, which I'm not a huge fan of, but they forgot to include it after making a big deal about it at the register.

The food itself was soggy after a less than 5 minute ride and I was pretty disappointed.

I have NEVER been disappointed in the food or the service.  Quite the contrary!  Food is always tasty and the wait staff have always been terrific!  We always time our arrivals a bit before normal lunch or dinner hours (arriving at c. 11:30 or 4:30), and we have never had a problem being seated.  Regardless of where I am, I always try to avoid arriving at restaurants during busy hours for OBVIOUS reasons.

Pgh Happy Hour is a facebook group of friends that like to check out new 'watering holes' every thursday and it's run by a guy that seems to party 24/7 while still holding down a very lucrative full time job.  

Anyway- Pgh HH was celebrating an anniversary and chose D&B for the location.  The D&B staff set up the back 'pool room' with complimentary,  enormous spread of appetizers with dips and kept refilling them when they got low.  Our server, Carla, was very attentive and friendly- making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point.  The other server back there was working equally as hard but I never got the chance to get her name.  

I had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but I never got the chance to give them any credit.

The décor was perfect for a neighborhood bar- not too many gaudy signs like Jacks or blinding neon in every corner. There were comfortable bar stools with backs around the bar and plenty of tables for larger parties.  
The only negative was the men's room- small and in need of an update but it was very clean.  My wife said the ladies room was very clean also.

We found seats at the bar and a friendly bartender greeted us and took our drink order.  The drafts arrived right away and we requested menu's...  

We ordered 2 shrimp cocktails and a calamari.  The shrimp arrived within 5 minutes and came with a small bowl of cocktail sauce with a dollop of horseradish on top.  I mixed mine as I love horseradish but my friend would have preferred it on the side or in another bowl as he isn't a fan.  The shrimp were big and fresh and delicious.  I mean- can you really mess up cold shrimp...?  The calamari took over a half hour to arrive.  It was pleasing to the eye and smelled delicious.  It had grilled onions & peppers on it with a slight spice dusted on top.  I thought it was delicious but my wife wasn't digging it.  She thought it was overcooked & rubbery.  Our friend isn't a fan of calamari so we didn't have a 3rd opinion to be the deciding factor...

Then things went south...
My wife went into the ladies room and came out with a straight up disgusted look on her face.  I saw her stop a waitress and after the 'chat' the waitress turned away and rolled her eyes.  Well, my wife said the bathroom was disgusting- Toilet paper & paper towels all over the floor, 5 stalls with only a half roll of toilet paper to be shared between all 5, no paper towels to dry your hands off after you washed them.  Does the employees have a separate washroom to use or do they use this one also and just don't notice???  The health dept signs say ""Employees must wash & dry hands with soap & hot water"".  Then I visited the Men's room and found almost the same thing- paper all over the floor in the stalls, I didn't notice if they had tp in there, and no paper towels to dry your hands with.  

To us- the bathrooms must be clean & well stocked or we wonder what the kitchen & other 'back of house' areas look like.  If the bathrooms are in this much need of attention- the kitchen must be worse...

127	rellBaGc6G4mgcqSACGL5w	2015-01-07	-ngOUdKMolLbIiV03qcLIg	3	"This used to be our favorite sushi & sashimi bar in Pittsburgh but it seems the quality & service are travelling down hill, or at least they were last night.  We went here for my birthday and were greeted by the hostess with a blank stare.  She didn't say anything...  Nothing...  So I said, 'Hi, we'd like a teppanyaki table', to which she responded with another blank stare.  Then I said 'Hibachi...' and she woke up and said, 'That'll be at least 15-20 minutes or so...' and then went back to her blank stare.  Nothing like, 'Would you like to grab seats at the bar? Start your meal off with a drink? How about a sushi roll while you wait...' nothing...  So I said, 'Ok, we'll wait...' and seated ourselves at the sushi bar.  It took at least 5 minutes for the actual waitress to appear and it seemed like it was a chore for her to get us a couple glasses of water.  She didn't offer any help picking out rolls or sushi so we were on our own.  We settled on a 'Steeler Roll' for $14.  Looking around at the closest hibachi table to us, I could see 6 people seated and 2 empty seats.  I figured they were waiting for someone- turned out they weren't.  I also assumed that maybe they had ordered already- they hadn't.  Had they ordered drinks already maybe- Nope...  It was obvious that the hostess just wanted to be ignorant and make us wait for another table.  Ok, fine.  She doesn't get tipped anyway.  So our roll arrives and we start in on it.  It tastes pretty good but the eel that we so love is being lost in the quantity of rice surrounding it.  It even had trouble staying together.  Then the hostess comes over and says 'Are you ready...?' to which I look at her, then at the roll, and say, 'We'll need a few minutes...'

On to the teppanyaki table...

The restaurant was super loud because I think there was an 'End of the Season Pittsburgh Steeler party' in the back room and they were making all kinds of commotion so I can't fault the waiter on how hard it was for all of us to hear him.  Oh, by the way- our table was only half full when they started service.  There was my wife & I and another couple.  Maybe they were trying to get us in & out quickly, I don't know...  Our waiter started to take our orders and I heard him offer the couple next to us, 'Would you like to upgrade your white rice for fried for an additional charge?' and they both said no.  Looking in the menu, I see that a side of fried rice without any purchase is $3.29 so when it came time for us to order, he offered the same thing and I asked him how much the 'upcharge' was.  $3.29 was his response.  Why wouldn't he just ask if we'd like an additional side of fried rice for $3.29 instead of making it sound like you were getting a better deal by declining the white rice in favor of fried for $3.29???  Stuff like this really bothers me so I told him, 'I would like fried rice but I also want the steamed rice I'm already paying for...' to which he says, 'Fine with me man, I don't care how much rice I bring out...'  Nice customer service...  Anyway, we ended up with the only American teppanyaki chef in the entire place, and he was just getting over bronchitis or something because he barely spoke and when he did, it was in a very low tone.  Don't get me wrong- he was a very nice guy...  My wife had ordered the Bob's Triple Combo (Strip steak, Chicken & Shrimp) and I ordered the Chef's Choice (Strip steak & Chicken).  They were both delicious and aside from the service issues, we had a very nice meal.  

We both agreed though- next time we're going out for sushi- we're going to Sake at South Side Works.  The chefs are much friendlier, the fish is fresher and the prices are much more reasonable (Half price on Sunday's & Monday's)"	review	Qs5dcst13DnQJwaBcR4VGg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 0}	3.81	{u'funny': 1, u'plain': 8, u'writer': 4, u'note': 5, u'hot': 5, u'cool': 5}	[2014, 2015]	3	[9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, 6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA, mdJZA5p391bCOZnvAxHV3w, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, tZ_9zVQA-0UY_UAWiBUYfg, 8ylnDiXbPXv0FL08vhAdMw, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, jThUkO26of_9arLY5zUszg, ZY_9dfURH3h7QD3itnJ_6w, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA]	Denny	80	user	{u'funny': 57, u'useful': 155, u'cool': 71}	2012-08

Don't go here...!

If you don't like smoke- don't go here.  If you have OCD and get hives when you see dust- don't go here.  If you don't like friendly old guys reliving their youth- don't go here.  If you're afraid of parallel parking- don't go here.  If you are allergic to vinyl seating surfaces- don't go here.  If you can't stand mellow classic rock (read: Led Zepplin)- don't go here.  If you're in a hurry- don't go here.  If you request 'Non-Smoking' ALL the time- don't go here.  If you are trying to become a hipster by smoking cigars- don't come here.  

Have I made my point?  But you're still reading...?  Great, then read on...

If you enjoy a good smoke, if you have a few hours to kill, if you love the idea of smoking in your own living room but hate the 'sticky-dirt' that accumulates on the walls only to be evident when you move your pictures around and find that your walls are 3 shades darker than when you first painted them, if you enjoy hearing stories that start out- 'When I was younger...' or 'When I was your age...', if you're not allergic to dust, if you have an open mind... you get the idea.  This place is a gem.

I'm a chill, relaxed, open minded, live & let live, love to hear stories, love to tell stories, love to BYO (as you can carry a 6 pack in here) kind of guy.  I was brought up in a 2 smoker household, my father quit cold turkey when I was about 12, my mother has reduced her cigarette intake drastically but still smokes daily.  I turned out ok.  No lasting effects, no long term issues.  I can't recall when I tried my first cigar and I can admit- I wasn't hooked.  I have evolved over time.  Now when I want to relax, when I want to recharge, I head to Blooms.  

Cigar Camp happens every Saturday.  What's that, you ask?  It's kind of like WDVE's Electric Lunch.  Michelle Michaels asks for 'lunch requests', she promises to 'try to get it on...' she 'Cooks it up & serves it hot'... but there's no lunch.  Here at Blooms- there's no Camp.  There's no tents, no campfire, no smores...  What there is is a very friendly owner (Mark) holding court and acting like the moderator of the debate on life.  My wife learned about Furries here, for god's sake!  She thought I was pulling her leg when I tried to explain it but after our second visit to Blooms when the old guys were discussing the upcoming weekend, she learned all she needed to know.  Cigar Camp does feed you though- there's usually ribs, corn bread, pulled pork, slaw, potato chips, all supplied by Mark (with a required purchase of course.  We all know there's No Free Lunch).  The 'campers' also bring stuff and we had our first taste of home-made Lemoncello here.    

Our first visit we learned how to get free cigars.  Years ago there was a bar in Homestead named Chiodos.  Chiodos was decorated with eclectic stuff.  Eclectic stuff and Bra's...  TONS of Bra's...  Well, I'm not sure who 'came' first- Blooms or Chiodos but Mark has bras all over the ceiling of the humidor.  I guess it keeps the cigars happy.  Anyway- we were taking the tour and my wife asked about them.  Turns out- if you give him your bra- you get a free cigar.  If you take it off in front of the 'cigar smoking court'- you get 2 cigars.  If you let him take a polaroid- 3 cigars.  My loving and open minded wife earned me 2 free cigars.  Pictures don't lie- but reviews can, she said.  ;) 

As for prices and the review that says the prices are high... Are you HIGH...?  Mark will take you to the $2 bin and tell you that this cigar is better than the $14 one 2 shelves over.  He'll tell you that the $4 ones are only half as good as the $8 ones.  He's not trying to win you over- he's telling you to think for yourself.  We're all individuals with our own tastes.  Try the $2 ones first, if you don't like them try a different one.  There's that saying that says 'You eat with your eyes first...' and those $2 cigars don't look like much but they have every bit as much taste as a $10 one with a fancy band.  Tell Mark what you want to spend and he'll pick the best cigar for your needs...  

Where am I gong with this review...?  I'm not exactly sure.  It's my very own 'trip down memory lane' that's continuously being added to, I guess.  But in the infamous words of Jimmy Buffett- 'The best navigators are not quite sure where they're going until they get there...'

The have an awesome selection of cigars ( not the largest- that distinction belongs to Blooms on 12th street ), but their prices are the best around.  I can't say they 'know their stuff' when it comes to cigars but face it- you're not going in there to ask the difference between a Macanudo and a Monticristo...  The cigars are always fresh and they are always 'over-the-top' friendly.  I buy here every time I need to stock up.

And when it comes to candy & snacks- this place can't be beat.  They have ALL you need to add to the kids lunches with their multi-packs and bundles...

My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak's ""25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh"" and he's usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.

Its been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. 

The food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.

-Fish Sandwiich
-Salmon (huge and delicious)
-Flounder
-Shrimp a few ways (""Norfolk"" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)
-Hawkins St Special
-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)

The prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem."	review	8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 1}	3.4	{u'funny': 1, u'plain': 2}	[]	0	[UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ]	Bennett	34	user	{u'funny': 16, u'useful': 42, u'cool': 10}	2012-11

Its always a zoo, the servers are not interested in what they are doing, and do it poorly. Food comes out of order or not at all. The managers don't care.

I was not too excited about trying to eat healthy at an Italian joint, but went with friends. I was impressed at how many healthier options they had, if that's what you're in the mood for. Or pig out on a hot plate of carbs and dairy with a side of italian sausage.

My friends and I split an order of beans, greens and tomatoes. I regret the sharing part, it was so outrageously delicious I wanted it all to myself. Next time I'm getting my own.

In the spirit of healthy eating, I went with a salad, which was big, fresh, and just what I wanted. If you like salad, you're set. If not, the pasta my friends had looked great too. You can get gluten free or whole wheat pasta for an additional charge if you like. My boy friend had angel hair with alfredo, our friend had linguini marinara with fried calamari.

The waitress was very pleasant, and kept her cool even though she had the pleasure of serving this merry band of drunk, vicious old queens.

Now I would have been sold on the service and the food, everything I tasted was great. But the two pasta dishes weren't all that hot. Somewhat warmer than warm, they said. My friend let the waitress know but wasn't unhappy enough to send it back, even though the manager was adamant they could remake  the plate in no time. (I work in a customer based industry and I know first hand, nothing can be worse than an unhappy customer who isn't willing to let you fix the problem after they bring it to your attention.) So at the end of the meal, he offered to buy us a round of drinks instead. Smart guy - offer a couple of drunks some free liquor, and all is forgiven. He took an almost great meal and made it great for them. Sadly, I was driving so didn't take him up on the offer. 

So - great food, beans and greens, lots of choices, beans and greens, good service, and beans and greens.

First, the menu turns me on. I love Mideastern food, and especially love Mideastern vegetarian fare. The menu has tons of things I love to eat, so I have lots and lots of reasons to go back. My boy friend is just opening up to the cuisine, and I really hoped this place would wow him. It could have, but instead just - ummm - ""not bad""-ed him. More on that soon.

The service was great. For a casual place, way out of the park. The waitress was on spot from the get go. Loved her. When the boy friend spilled an entire iced tea, her coworker came running to help and they both smoothed it over and cleaned up the mess. They even let him have another tea, even though I voted to cut him off since he'd clearly had enough.

So why three stars? Some real bizarreness on their part. 

We both had soups, which we loved. I had a wrap, which was great. The hot stuff hot, the cold stuff cold, and everything delicious. He had a sampler with salad, rice, and three kinds of grilled meat. Which was great, except the rice was cold. Not warm, cold. Like grandma sat it outside in the snow cold. He immediately let her know, no problem she'll get hot rice. They just made it fresh. She just as quickly came back and said they would have to microwave it, there would be no fresh order of rice. He wasn't into the idea of microwaved salad and meat, nor the idea of someone picking his plate apart for him to microwave rice, which doesn't taste the best microwaved anyhow. He said never mind forget it. She wasn't liking that idea, kudos to her. She went to the kitchen and got a manager to pry the rice away from whoever was being so cranky about it, and brought it out a few minutes later.

Yay! Fresh, cold rice. 

No joke, after she went to all that work to make his order perfect, they sent out cold rice a second time. He wasn't eating it so I stuck my finger in it to see - yeah, about the temperature of my carrot juice. Cool. Not warm. Not very appetizing, and not even a safe temperature to keep food. 

Silly thing to get wrong twice, I think. So aside from that, I was very, very happy with the place, and want to go back. I hope they'll earn back that last star."	review	8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.4	{u'funny': 1, u'plain': 2}	[]	0	[UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ]	Bennett	34	user	{u'funny': 16, u'useful': 42, u'cool': 10}	2012-11

I had a veggie breakfast burrito, the man had a more traditional breakfast. The burrito was .  . . edible. It was enormous, big enough to feed me for a day and still have leftovers. Inside a soggy tortilla I had mounds of scrambled eggs and about 2 pounds of vegetables - onions, peppers, avocado, tomato, hashbrowns, and then some. Most of the vegetables tasted very, very steamed, and then doused in grease. There wasn't much taste to them at all, and I love my vegetables. It makes me sad someone discovered a way to make them taste so uninteresting. On top of the whole affair was their spanish sauce (tomato paste?) and an unmelted square of orange cheese-like product. All in all, it didn't taste bad, but that's not high praise for restaurant food.

His breakfast was easily as big, and looked much better than mine tasted. The waitress got the order close, but not quite right, and he didn't have the interest to send it back. It was good, but too greasy for him to eat very much of it.

If it were cheaper I would say it was a good value.

When you walk in the door there is a sign that says Rule #1: the customer is always right. Rule #2: if the customer is wrong, see rule #1. They could use some reminding.

After ordering a couple sandwiches, which were handed over quickly, walked up to pay. There was one older lady there trying to pay, and the cashier was bickering with her. She had put her soup in the wrong container, it seems, and the cashier was yelling at her about it. She got the right container and poured the lady's soup in there, which didn't work very well and soup went everywhere. So she started cleaning soup, all the while berating the customer. (To be fair, by the time I walked up they were both very cranky, and I know its hard to be nice to someone when they are fussing at you - but that's the woman's job.) 

By the time she finished cleaning the counter, the woman's purchases, and finally got around to ringing her up, the line had backed up quite a lot. It took nearly 10 minutes. Then I went up and the girl started snapping at me too, and went on complaining about the last customer, which I found to be really rude. Finally I was able to pay and grab a seat.

The fish sandwich was good, as advertised. The fries were horrendous. Already cold when served, they were a mass of congealed grease by the time we sat. I ate one and gave up on them. The coleslaw was nice though. The fries were an odd problem to me - in a place with that many fryers, they should always be fresh.

The market I liked a lot, and I'll be back there, probably a lot. They sell chicken feet, which makes broth that makes me happy."	review	8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.4	{u'funny': 1, u'plain': 2}	[]	0	[UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ]	Bennett	34	user	{u'funny': 16, u'useful': 42, u'cool': 10}	2012-11

165	mVHrayjG3uZ_RLHkLj-AMg	2014-11-03	uf61rPucuICXhSPXlZ1hIQ	5	"After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.

Well, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.

And yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.

So off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. 

We walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'

This is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.

Oh...but good food counts too. 

We each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!

My friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...

The waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. 

They only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.

Emil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.

You definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.

Addendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh."	review	tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 1}	3.52	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 3, u'plain': 10, u'writer': 22, u'note': 12, u'hot': 14, u'cool': 22}	[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, 9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA, RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA, 6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew, op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q, jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw, SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	William	118	user	{u'funny': 195, u'useful': 457, u'cool': 162}	2011-08

On the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.

Well, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.

The second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.

I was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.

We hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.

The mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. 

After the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. 

Well, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.

Thank goodness for the basic salad bar.

Even my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.

The irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.

Third base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.

From what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food. But apparently, mama has left the kitchen."	review	tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 3, u'plain': 10, u'writer': 22, u'note': 12, u'hot': 14, u'cool': 22}	[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, 9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA, RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA, 6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew, op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q, jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw, SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	William	118	user	{u'funny': 195, u'useful': 457, u'cool': 162}	2011-08
167	eOv0Dbq2E8sd0CKMAqTImw	2013-10-13	J_YCuxcejf_HivFLK6tJbA	3	"Recently I've found myself patronizing Bellevue a little more, namely because I've bought a house in the area, and have been checking out some of the mom and pops along the little strip of Mayberry RFD that is the quaint main street. Luigi's is one of those little mom and pops that offers standard basic Italian in a comfortable setting. It's a little kitchy, red-white-and-green, with Dino and Frankie tunes playing in the background.

I've stopped in on several occasions now for dinner, with various friends, and the food has been consistent...it's good...satisfying. Not over-the-top gourmet, or even in the remotest sense 'pretentious'. It's just a good ol' night out for some pasta or lasagna, with a side salad, garlic bread and conversation with your pals.

The portions are ample, the prices are reasonable, the flavors won't knock your socks off and make you think you've died and gone to Sicily, but they won't make you cringe at having given your money to a profiteering Chef Boyardee either. The service is decent, kind of point blank, not rude, nor over the top friendly. 

The crowd can fluctuate between 'Oh my god, I'm surrounded by Hillbillies' to 'the local gathering at Mayberry', but that seems to be the norm for most places in da burgh.

I've not had the pizza, which apparently get raves, because frankly I only think of pizza as coming in a box to my front door when I'm too lazy to do any cooking at home. But I've had three or four of the pasta dishes, and they come in a generous portion, with a side salad and an order of garlic toast. They taste fine, fill you up, and don't break your bank.

And for a local neighborhood joint, that's exactly what I'd hope for. A place you can go to find a dependable and reasonable meal, on a semi-regular basis, in a comfortable setting, with no frills or pretense. 

And that is exactly what Luigi's is."	review	tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 2}	3.52	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 3, u'plain': 10, u'writer': 22, u'note': 12, u'hot': 14, u'cool': 22}	[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, 9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA, RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA, 6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew, op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q, jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw, SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	William	118	user	{u'funny': 195, u'useful': 457, u'cool': 162}	2011-08

If you're seeking the gourmet fancy-schmancy, or the self-restrictive dietary vegan-gluten-free blah blah blah, your choices may be a little more limited, but if you're a 'normal' eater, it's a grocery store that has all of the basics and a few frills. No one will speak to you with a fake Hampton accent dahhhhhling, and you won't find a wine-tasting class with a gourmet fritter exhibition.

What you will find are regular folk who are helpful and (mostly) friendly, the usual grocery store variety of necessities and non-necessities, a nicely stocked and priced meat and produce case, a deli counter with the usual meats and cheeses and a variety of prepared foods, baked goods. It's clean and tidy, and you can stock your fridge and pantry as you see fit, and with a pleasant 'How ya doin'?'

Kuhn's still does the double-coupon thing, and they have some pretty good sales - ten boxes of pasta for ten bucks, the weekly soda sales - three fridge packs for nine bucks beats monster bird's $12.

Now I will say that on occasion, it will feel a little like you've somehow been sucked into deep Appalachia in regard to some of the clientele, but that's pretty much everywhere in da burgh that's on the 'outskirts'. Sometimes I look around me and half expect to find a rusty 1950's pick up truck full of goats in the parking lot, or a trailer park nearby.

I generally do my 'staple' shopping at Aldi, and my meat needs in the Strip, but for a nearby quick fill in, unless it's an ingredient for a specialty recipe, Kuhn's is great for the 'Oh crap - I need' kind of trip.

And quite frankly, as nice as they are, and decently priced as they are, this small business deserves our business more than the cut throat monster bird."	review	tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 1}	3.52	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 3, u'plain': 10, u'writer': 22, u'note': 12, u'hot': 14, u'cool': 22}	[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, 9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA, RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA, 6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew, op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q, jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw, SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	William	118	user	{u'funny': 195, u'useful': 457, u'cool': 162}	2011-08
169	ucKQlQvOeJxETLNkpKcaSw	2013-10-13	PbShi6oerP0TxfuYZADazQ	3	"I am very happy to be moving into a 'neighborhood' that has a line-up of decent mom-and-pop shops to find a reasonable meal when the cupboard is bare, or the energy banks are depleted for cooking. Bellevue does seem to have a small collection of decent eats at reasonable prices, and The Rusty Nail is one of that handful of good examples of neighborhood haunts.

It's touted as a 'diner' in many of the reviews, but it really is a step above your average 'diner', and is more of a cozy neighborhood gathering spot for a decent burger, or entree. I've not made it there for the breakfast, but have always been satisfied by the dinners.

Rusty Nail is hardly on the gourmet end of the scale. In fact, I would imagine the Sysco truck pulls up out back regularly with deliveries of food parts, from cans of sauces to frozen animal chunks. As long as those parts are assembled and doctored to make them seem a bit fresher than the typical conveyor-belt diner, all is fine. And indeed, all IS fine.

So few of our local 'diners' are up to snuff when it comes to serving up decent 'diner' fare, that I can't call Rusty Nail a diner. It's a neighborhood family restaurant. Period.

Burgers, meatloaf, pot roast, fish sammiches, salads, pastas...a varied but adequate menu. Fair and decent prices. Friendly and attentive service. A cozy enough atmosphere (although I have to say AGAIN in a review of a restaurant, if you've got multiple TVs in the space, for gods sake, can ONE of them NOT be showing SPORTS coverage??) and a pleasant crowd of patrons. 

During my last visit, there was a large family gathering at the next table. A nicely polished middle-class clan, ranging in age from gramps to granddaughter. At one point, dad received a phone call on his cell...and actually stepped OUTSIDE to have his conversation. As I was leaving I had to pat him on the back and thank him for being one of the few remaining decent guys with manners!

Bottom line...Rusty Nail is comfortable. It's not a drive-out-of-you-way destination for dining. It is what it is. A great little neighborhood spot FOR the neighborhood.

I knew the building from the early 80's when it had been one of Pittsburgh's dive gay bars called 'The Tender Trap', and knowing this, as well as a lot about the Big Bistroid Group...oops...Big BURRITO Group, I was curious to try it out and see if it lived up to the usual Big Burrito hype.  And voila, indeed, it's another excruciatingly overpriced bistroid in da burgh.

The atmosphere is actually quite lovely, inside or out. The colors are comfortable, the noise levels subtle, the seating comfortable, and the service staff looks professional (YOUNG) with no Coney Island side show appearances.

The service was good. Not overly friendly, but not uppity like young people waiting tables in more upscale restaurants tend to be in da bugh.

The menu was short, but did have a list of pretty unique offerings.  My friend had a salmon salad, and I opted to try the Farm Lamb Mac-n-Cheese.  The waiter brought a small basket with bread to the table accompanied by a single medium sized pat of salted butter to spread.  For a beverage, we both opted for just water.

I have to say, if I actually had to pay for this, I would have been pretty miffed.  

For LUNCH, the prices were all around the $15 range, and the portions were NOT large.  The portions were actually fine for lunch, not overly filling (by any stretch of the imagination), but they didn't leave you hungry.

I can't speak for the salmon, as I have NEVER had salmon in any form other than lox that didn't taste like a dried sawdust version of some strong fish. She seemed to enjoy it very much, so there it is.

The Farm Lamb mac n cheese was tasty. The lamb was tender and moist, and the mac n cheese was a tiny tube pasta with a very nice creamy cheesy sauce, all topped with a bread crumb covering when it was broiled until crispy.  It was accompanied by a 'pinch' of mesclun salad topped with another pinch of fried onions.

Basically - take one large spoonful of mac n cheese with a higher end cheese sauce and a fancier noodle than comes in the average box - mix in about four cubes of roast lamb, sprinkle on a layer of bread crumbs and toss it in the broiler until the crumbs are toasted - then using your index finger and thumb, pick up a pinch of mesclun and sit it on the plate next to the mac n cheese bowl - and you have a bistroid expensive art project on a plate.

Seriously? $15 for lunch? It's mac n cheese people!

I also have to call into question the name and theme.  Mad Mex is bistroid Tex Mex.  Soba is bistroid Asian.  Kaya is bistroid Caribbean-ish.  Casbah? Farm Lamb mac n cheese? Sure, I can see this as a box lunch while riding a camel through the desert...not.

I can't say the experience was awful. The company was awesome, and we had a nice unpressured amount of time for fun chat.  The atmosphere was comfortable, and the food was tasty.  But was it all worthy of a return trip or recommendation?  I honestly can't say 'yes' with any kind of cheerleader rave.  

I'm not quite sure that I comprehend the mindset of people in this burgh who think paying that kind of money for food is worth it, when honestly, food with just as much flavor can be found in abundance around town for half the price and twice the portion. 

Who are all of these easily dupe-able rich people, and where do they come from? Want to blow that kind of money?

171	hHUxynhRliO0rdjgPYesOw	2012-07-28	cioJ1j7k10l1YjqVLC9YlA	2	"For many years, my best friend and her mother were season ticket holders and when her mother reached a point in age where she could no longer fully appreciate theater (sight and hearing), I became the theater companion. We've been going now for three years, and although the overall 'experience' of the Public is pleasant, the base reason of why I attend 'theater' has been a mixed bag of mostly disappointment.

The theater itself is a grand and beautiful piece of architecture. Acoustically sound, very comfortable, clean and organized.  The staff, from box office to ushers, is always pleasant and helpful. As with all theaters, the concessions are overpriced, but in this era, that's to be expected. 

The theater offers a LOT of 'fun' incentives to draw in groups and keep folks as regular attendees, like the brunch series for season ticket holders, or the wine Wednesdays, and other 'groupings' that give 'value added' to the experience.

My friend and I have our tickets on what we call 'donut day', or the brunch series. It kind of an all-you-can-eat continental breakfast with mass donuts, bagels and pastries from Giant Eagle, with coffee and tea.  It's a nice incentive, but we've begun to look forward to the donuts more so than the actual 'theatre' experience.

The reason I go to the 'theater' is to enjoy the play that's on the stage, and in the past three years, I've been mostly disappointed with the productions. I've seen a LOT of live theater in my life, from small low budget black box, to college, to Broadway tours, with varying levels of production value, but with a much broader range than I've yet to see at the Public.

I've even seen a few productions in other 'less substantial' theaters that the Public presented in the past three years, and had to wonder 'what were they THINKING?' One production, 'ART' comes specifically to mind, having seen it in Florida presented by a mid-level budget theater company with high production value that nailed the script, characterizations and flow 100%. I was excited to see the show again, as it is a spectacular piece of writing - when done right. The moment I walked into the Public's production and sat down and looked at the set, I had to say 'HUH????'  The play that followed kept me saying 'Huh?' They totally missed the boat on direction, character development, as well as a just wrong set.

Their choices in season also seem to pander heavily to the 'donors' and not to 'theatre' lovers. With all of the scripts available in the world, and I've seen a LOT of them, I have to ask why most of the more challenging pieces (intellectually as well as artistically) are never touched. After three years, we're now asking ourselves if buying season tickets is really worth it, when so many of the shows in the season we've already seen - but we seem to go back out of habit, not out of enjoyment.  This past season, 'Private Lives' was part of the season. I saw Private Lives at the public in the 80's. Pittsburgh Irish and Classical did it three or four years ago. Theatre Factory in Trafford did it two years ago. Again this past year at the Public?  Seriously?  

The sets for most productions have been great (except for ART), and the performances have been 'ok', with some capable performers who were doing 'just ok'. Exceptions were Superior Donuts, God Of Carnage, and Circle Mirror Transformation. Three plays in three years that were exceptional and worthy of exceptional applause.

Yet, da burgh audiences give out standing ovations for EVERYTHING, whether or not it deserves a standing ovation. Do they really believe that all of what they're seeing it exceptional? If so, they need to get out of the box a little more to really experience the difference between 'Yeah, that was ok' and 'WOW!'. 

I really miss well-done challenging live theater, and rarely do I find it in Pittsburgh. Instead, I end up settling for an day out with lunch or dinner, good company, and two hours of 'diversion' on the stage that make going to the movies more appealing.  And for me, this is what the Public is...

Maybe it's just Pittsburgh, and a matter of 'giving them what they want'. But every time I receive a 'now playing' e-mail from the many theater sites I belong to, and read the synopsis of the MANY production listings, I drool, and wonder 'Why can't anyone do this stuff HERE??'

The Public SHOULD be that venue. And their productions SHOULD be on that exceptional level.  Sadly, they just aren't."	review	tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 1}	3.52	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 3, u'plain': 10, u'writer': 22, u'note': 12, u'hot': 14, u'cool': 22}	[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, 9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA, RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA, 6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew, op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q, jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw, SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	William	118	user	{u'funny': 195, u'useful': 457, u'cool': 162}	2011-08
172	kj3qws3WSMgOotUeACSdFA	2014-11-08	fzVpff0OZ3YdHwR5TagQ9w	3	"Ok, so what we have here is an early century gem that is kind of covered by a thick layer of lack of knowledge and interest in history.

We stopped in before a two-store 'block party' in the area, and having heard about it for years and never been in, we decided to check it out. Entering was kind of a wonderment initially, scoping out a somewhat back-in-time feel and appearance, with shelves of old style candies and gums for sale, a menu board with a handful of varieties of ice creams, sundaes and other concoctions available for somewhat reasonable prices. And the Terrazzo floors are pristine and gorgeous. 

The decor is mostly original old soda fountain, with original shelves and display cases, beautiful marble tables and wooden booths, and original snack counter, vintage blenders, etc.

I ordered a double espresso and my friend ordered a coffee, and I do have to say kudos for knowing how to properly fill a double shot demitasse. The espresso was a little on the sour side, but good enough for what I expected at an ice cream store.

I think that what could make this place fantastic would be eliminating the 'youth' from the employee team, or at least replacing them with folks who had a clue what that era represents, and how to recreate it, or, at the very, VERY least, educating the youth on what it was like, and how to recreate it.

When I'm sitting at a vintage marble table, sipping espresso from a demitasse, I'm a bit thrown off by hipster music coming from a Pandora box, and a service staff that looks like they just came to work directly from the Urban charter school, dressed like silly high school kids.

I sampled the ice cream, the death by chocolate...and although it tasted 'ok', hearing the story that this old fashioned ice cream parlor bought their ice creams from Penn State Creamery, and did not make their own, well, that was about as 'authentic' as the Necco company candy reproductions being sold to 'look' vintage, but all of which were really just watered down versions of the originals.

This place could be so much more than it is, a true destination, if the 'theming' was carried through in a more careful and thoughtful manner. Turn off the hipster tunes, and put on some big band or old fashioned malt shop tunes. Try a nice crisp uniform instead of saggy (or skinny) jeans with a sloppy looking over shirt or T-shirt. 

What should be a very cool and warm, inviting atmosphere plays off as a little cold and sadly weathered.

Create a few more aspects of the true old fashioned malt shop, ice cream parlour and lunch counter, instead of a 'trendy' collection of outside sourced lunch options, and the run of the mill sundae collection, simply renamed to be 'cool'. Throw in a kitchen sink challenge, maybe some home made baked good...

It's a very cool little building and spot...with SO much potential. 

In South Florida is a place called Jaxson's...this place ALWAYS had a line so far out the door that they'd hire a keyboardist to play in the parking lot to keep people entertained while waiting, and they'd pass popcorn out to the waiting line.  They also had the vintage candy shelves, and you could truly find ANYTHING still made. Their ice creams were all made in house, and they would have bells and whistles going off if you ate the whole 'Kitchen Sink', or similar creation. They had a nice simple kitschy line of 'real' meals, to accompany the ice cream

THIS was a 'destination', not just an after thought.  And this is what Klavon's SHOULD strive to be."	review	tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 3, u'plain': 10, u'writer': 22, u'note': 12, u'hot': 14, u'cool': 22}	[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, 9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA, RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA, 6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew, op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q, jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw, SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	William	118	user	{u'funny': 195, u'useful': 457, u'cool': 162}	2011-08
173	-nfzEVOVvmDSFbxvBsllGQ	2013-08-17	sBp0khZdSo6wnf90AFhwNQ	1	"After a work happy hour a few doors away, several of us were looking for a place to eat, and were having a hard time deciding. I was the pain in the tukkhas, since I'd driven my antique car, and kind of needed to be able to park it where I could see it, plus, I'd really planned the evening to be a birthday dinner for one of the co-workers. We decided to split up, and me and the birthday girl go somewhere, and the rest would hit something within walking distance. Then as Birthday girl and I got to my car, we realized we were parked in front of a restaurant, and Mahoney's won out by default.

We should have gotten in the car and driven somewhere else.

The atmosphere was pleasant enough, but the food...yeesh.

Everyone placed their orders, mostly sandwiches of one variety of another, sided with fries, plain or sweet potato, or slaw. I ordered the Reuben hoping for the best, but definitely not receiving it.

Michael's chicken breast with plain fries arrived with sweet potato fries, and instead of just bringing him a side of regular fries, they took the whole plate back to make the switch. Kim's turkey Rachel arrived, and as it was handed in her direction, half of the stuffing fell off the plate and onto the floor. The server took the plate back to the kitchen so that Rachel could be re-stuffed, and for the rest of the evening her initial guts laid right there on the floor. Kim #2 had a fried fish sandwich, which looked a little withered, and then there was my Reuben. More like an Ewwwwww-ben.

The bread was dry as chalk, and the corned beef had been so overdone, it looked like bacon sticking out of the bread. Dry, dry, dry...and I took maybe two bites of the slaw, and that was quite enough.

The prices aren't steep, but seriously people, take some pride in what you're handing off to a customer. Would YOU eat that?? Seriously, put that order down on the counter in front of you...and take one minute to LOOK at it...then make one exactly like it for yourself. Are you gonna eat that? If not, um, why would we want to pay for it?

The service was pleasant enough, and the atmosphere was comfortable enough for nice conversation. But would I go back? Nope. The food, my reason for going to a restaurant, was dreck.

174	Lm_mR5xDF91OeZw97ch41g	2012-04-26	xdcGleb7KshOeyIxxDb_yg	3	"For years, when going to the theater, my friend and I have eaten across the street at Indian Spices, or occasionally next door at Christo's, looking out one window and into the window of Lemon Grass.  They never looked especially busy (but then during theater times, I've rarely been anywhere downtown that really WAS 'especially busy') and we really didn't know anything about it.  So on this particular foray into a night with Lily Tomlin, we thought we'd try something different.

I see all the growling reviews here complaining about...well...everything...from service to food, and frankly, I'm not quite sure we were all at the same restaurant.

I'm also a bit confused by most people calling it 'Thai' when the menu says 'Cambodian'.

Lemon Grass was pleasant.  They did seem to operate with minimal staff, but they certainly seemed to keep up.  There was a small group of diners when we arrived, and that number grew while we were there, seemed like mostly people who were going to the same show we were.

The menu options were quite ethnic and unusual from things I'd seen on most Asian menus, which to me, was very cool. Couldn't pronounce them, but the ingredients were certainly unlike the others, so we decided to try a couple of dishes we'd never tried before, including an appetizer.

The appetizers were called 'Na Taings' and were like little non-sweet rice krispie treats that came with a very yummy pork and curry sauce to top them with.  There were five on the plate.  Several of their appetizers came 5 to the plate.  Ok folks, what is UP with the odd numbers on appetizer plates around here lately?  If you're sharing with another person, do we really want to incite a riot over who gets the last one?  Even Stevens is best on any shared plate.  Two for you, two for me, or three for you, three for me...not 'Oh no, you go ahead'  'No, YOU go ahead, really'.

Anyway, the appetizer was quite tasty and hit the spot.

My friend ordered hot tea, which seemed to come in a magical pot.  The pot was only about two inches tall, and about as round as a very small tortilla, but it filled both of our normal sized cups three times.  It was a beautiful little creation of a pot, I must say. It looked like cast iron, and was very ornamental, and came with its own matching trivet to rest upon.  The tea was a very flavorful jasmine. How six cups managed to fit in that tiny pot is amazing.

For the entrees, I cannot remember the names of the dishes, nor can I find them listed online. Lemon Grass doesn't seem to have its own website, and all of the menu sites only appear to have a minimalist lunch menu, or something outdated.

My friend ordered something with many vowels and consonants, that was a seafood-curry-vegetable mix on a bed of 'crispy rice noodles', and I ordered another dish with many vowels and consonants, that was a pork based curry and vegetable (but lower on the veggie count) also over a bed of crispy rice noodles.

After the waitress took our order, she came back from the kitchen to inform my friend that the dish she'd ordered was out, so my friend opted for the same as I.

The dishes arrived.  There was a giant mound of crispy white rice noodles, and they were indeed 'crispy', with a decent sized spot of the actual meat and curry portion nestled against it, with a ginormous decorative flower made of beet (my plate) and carrot (her plate) on a landscaping of parsley.  We switched plates...beets make me gag.  Then the waitress asked if we wanted chopsticks, and well...not so functional for a blind woman, but I opted to use them.

The dish was unusual and quite delicious - but a CHORE to eat, with either a fork OR chop sticks.  The first bite I tried to take with the chop sticks literally thrust the end of a very rigid rice noodle right up my right nostril.  In my friend's case, even with a fork, rice noodles were flying.  But, all in all, it was quite delicious. It was pork, a curry gravy, some bean sprouts, and fried egg strips.  Honestly, except for the grrrrrr of trying to contain the crispy rice noodles to the plate, it was a tasty and filling meal.  Quite pleasant, and it was nice to try something 'new' to us.

The bill wasn't outrageous, just under $40 for two entrees, an appetizer, and a pot of tea.

We both agreed that we'd go back...but next time we'll avoid the 'crispy' noodles for something a bit more malleable like rice or soft noodles.

The staff was fine and helpful - the food decent.  Heck the only thing that made the evening even slightly unpleasant was the cackling yinzer at one table who apparently thought she was in her own dining room at home.

For the pre-theater or concert scenario, I do recommend it.  It's worth a shot, especially if you're an 'outside the box' eater.  Try something you can't pronounce...what the heck."	review	tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 1}	3.52	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 3, u'plain': 10, u'writer': 22, u'note': 12, u'hot': 14, u'cool': 22}	[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, 9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA, RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA, 6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew, op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q, jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw, SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	William	118	user	{u'funny': 195, u'useful': 457, u'cool': 162}	2011-08

People's is a small 'family' Indian restaurant, with a LOT of tables, and the last time I went, a LOT of people filling those seats.

As with most Indian lunch buffets, the offerings are basic and of a very low spice level - but tasty in their 'homogenized' way. It's VERY inexpensive, and worth the all-you-can-eat.  They offer several meat and non-meat choices, plenty of sides, rice, nan, salads, chutneys - and even a pretty yummy hot chai tea that is very creamy and sweet.

The service is pleasant, and the atmosphere is comfortable.  Although when they're really busy, you may be forced to make a new friend at the next table, which really is pretty much the same as them sitting at YOUR table.

The crowd was interesting as well, students en masse, single diners, and pairs - all seeming a little more on the intellectual end of the scale than one might normally see in da burgh.

My only disappointment was the palak paneer which had potato instead of the cheese...although I may have just read the sign wrong, and it wasn't really palak paneer.  The chicken dish was absolutely delicious, and the samosa were yummy.

Can't do Indian food without a big ol' samosa with the green mint chutney sauce.

Generally, nothing uber-fancy, but definitely worth a try."	review	tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 2}	3.52	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 3, u'plain': 10, u'writer': 22, u'note': 12, u'hot': 14, u'cool': 22}	[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, 9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA, RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA, 6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew, op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q, jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw, SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	William	118	user	{u'funny': 195, u'useful': 457, u'cool': 162}	2011-08
176	FD6OocZdFUfE2J5H0WN4fA	2012-03-17	oW3xz2arSNdRm1zyt9NSOA	3	"Thanks to the 'pretend we're Irish and drink til we puke' parade, a basketball tournament AND a visit by the Vice President, my blind friend and I sat in her handicap Access Van for almost an hour in the Strip District not moving an INCH as traffic was absolutely BLOCKED from all directions, apparently from the time the VP landed at the airport until he LEFT for the airport, cutting off our plans to attend the theater at the proverbial knees. Thank goodness for cell phones, we were able to change our theater tickets to the following weekend, and had our van driver turn around and get us the hell out of the mess. 

But now that we had the day planned and thwarted by the city that can't think fully, what were we going to do?  We asked the driver to drop us off in Bloomfield, and we would have lunch there...but where?  Tessaro's was OUT (see my review for Tessaro's) and so many things had come and gone since I've been to Bloomfield that we weren't sure what would be there.  Pleasure Bar was out, after redneck hillbillies with guns started bashing 'fags', and Pleasure Bar didn't seem too concerned about it. 

AHA!  I've heard so much about it, and never actually went in and tried it...so voila, the plan was hatched...Armand's for a fish sandwich!

I had just thought about a 'fish fry' type sandwich the night before, knowing that St. Raphael's down the street was holding their Lent fish fry...but I have a problem handing money over to a Catholic fundraiser anything, and frankly, their spaghetti dinner for a army officer's fundraiser was a little on the Chef-Boy-Ar-Dee side.

Walking into Armand's was a little bit of a shock.  I did NOT expect it to be an absolute dive bar, and at 1:30 in the afternoon, it was pretty much full of dive bar regulars.  My second surprise was that they also allowed smoking, which I am not for or against, being a smoker, but the air was a deep stale rank dive bar smoke filled atmosphere.  

We started to sit in the bar area, and then I noticed some Burger King type booths in a back room, and asked the bar tender how we ordered the fish? He directed us to the back room, and said that we'd have to order there.

We made our way to the back room, and there we found a little ordering window, with a minimal menu.  Fish sandwiches, large and small, shrimp baskets, large and small, burger, a few toppings that were extra (cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles) and a few sides (fries, zucchini planks, cheese sticks, cole slaw, etc.) and that was about it.  Sodas were $1, and came from a machine in the room.

We ordered one large, and one small fish sandwich, fries, and zucchini planks, and I bought two cans of soda from the machine.  We did have to wait a little while for the food, but we learned why, and it was absolutely fine.  

A woman from the bar came back and asked if the lady in the kitchen had 'forgotten' her fish.  The lady responded ""No, I didn't forget it, I have a bunch of orders, and I have to cut it, bread it, clean the grease, and cook it!  I'll bring it out to you as soon as it's done!""

This one woman was doing it ALL, and she was doing it from scratch.  When she got the other woman's fish on a plate and started walking it out, she paused by our table and said that she'd have ours in just a minute.  She then explained the woman asking if she'd forgotten again, and the whole process, and said ""She ain't at McDonald's!  This is the best fish sandwich in town for a reason!  People can be a real F$%king pain in my A$$!""  

And I thought - atta girl - I'm at home!  This is going to be great!

She brought out our plates.  Ilene's 'small' was rather large, and my large was basically the same 'size' but with a double helping of fish. The fries were decent, and the zucchini really looked like she had taken one medium sized zucchini, rammed it through a slicer lengthwise, battered it, and fried it up. They were HUGE strips, all from the same zucchini.  

The food was good.  I'm not going to say 'best' fish sandwich. But it was huge, tasty, and the sides were good.  I will say that Frankie's fish sandwich at Cattivo is more complete, and a little more flavorful, but not nearly as big...and it's pretty big.  So so far, Cattivo still wins, but Armand's comes in second.  Both places are bars, and both allow smoking, but Cattivo is bigger and airier (which can dissipate the smoke concentration), and sandwich has a bit more 'flair' to make it tastier.  

Prices at Armand's are average. $8 something for the small and $10 something for the large, but all toppings are ala carte.

Don't dismiss the sandwich though for the dive bar atmosphere.  It IS a sought after years old tradition - and apparently consistent.  If you're hankering for a good jumbo sized fish sandwich, no frills, like the corner dive bar used to serve up all over town - well kids, this one still does it the way it's supposed to be done.

177	YTqSkgOiiI9HG3hNH7ovfg	2012-07-11	xQi2N9gBJB-lBWpIPKsVmA	4	"Once again, the best friend and I were out and about on errands - in this case, her appointment with the dentist - and what better food choice to explore before 'open wide' than good old family Italian? Can we get extra onions with that?

We decided to give the lunch buffet a try, and arrived around 11:30 am. Sign on the door said hours were 11 am to whatever, but we got there to find the doors still locked.  I walked around the corner to see a studly guy standing outside the back door smoking, and asked if they were open. He looked at me surprised, and said he'd be right there. He came and unlocked the front doors, and in we went, past the muscle man with the cool brown eyes.

We were the first to arrive, and as I looked around the room(s) and I have to say it was kind of charming in that 1970's Soprano's kind of way. Like a mom and pop Italian place you'd expect to find somewhere in Jersey.  This is kind of living proof that Pittsburgh is indeed stuck in 1979, but in this case, in a GOOD way. There's even a baby grand piano just inside the front doors.

We did not order from the menu, as I said, we went to try the lunch buffet and I have to say, we were impressed.

It is not a large buffet, quite small in fact, but ample for only $7.95.  It basically contains a chafing dish of appetizers (this day had Clams Casino, some kind of fried mashed potato balls and fried zucchini), another with a pasta dish (tomato vodka today with fresh basil - VERY delicious), two meats (something like a beef brisket in one and the other a chicken cacciatore - the beef was excellent, as was the chicken), a small selection of salads (pasta, tossed, slaw and a bowl of beets), a tray of bread and rolls, and two different cakes for dessert.

Now, even though we were the first to arrive, meaning early and the food was fresh, the chef and his trainee kept attending to the hot foods, showing sincere concern that it all stay fresh...and it did the entire time we were there. 

The waitress was a very pretty 'woman' as opposed to the usual college student, and was extremely nice and helpful. The muscle man was apparently the bartender - ok - you can stand there and look pretty as long as you like.

They carried Pepsi products, so we ordered fresh brewed tea instead, and it was fine.

Total bill for two for a very satisfying lunch buffet was $20 and some change, very pleasant service AND eye candy, and a quaint trip down 'Scenes From An Italian Restaurant' meets 'Soprano's' memory lane.  

I can't speak for dinner (yet) but if the food is as good, skip the pretentious Bistroids, and barking manager of Del's, and the potential gunfire from Pleasure Bar...and give them a shot. And DEFINITELY drop by for a super inexpensive and pleasant lunch if you happen to find yourself in the Bloomfield neighborhood."	review	tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 1}	3.52	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 3, u'plain': 10, u'writer': 22, u'note': 12, u'hot': 14, u'cool': 22}	[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, 9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA, RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA, 6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew, op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q, jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw, SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	William	118	user	{u'funny': 195, u'useful': 457, u'cool': 162}	2011-08
178	YTqSkgOiiI9HG3hNH7ovfg	2012-09-01	WOHaUAtOOTjdSig_cko6JQ	2	"Well, as stated in the previous review of their lunch buffet, we finally went for dinner, and were horribly disappointed to discover a night-and-day comparison between the lunch and dinner. I had gnocchi, she had Veal Imperial, and we ordered 'traditional style' which meant for an addition $4 it came with marinated mushrooms, Clams Casino, soup and salad. My friend left 1/3 of her veal dish on her plate and didn't want to take it home. I took a bite, and my tongue experienced absolutely no flavor, to the extent that I had to take a sip of my iced tea to see if I was getting a cold and losing my sense of taste. I could taste the tea. I could taste absolutely NOTHING from her veal.  With the gnocchi, I ordered the sausage, which was again $3 extra, and when it arrived it was a flat sausage patty cut in half, that tasted like a dry sausage McMuffin patty. The salad was basic iceberg lettuce and a few other veggies. The wedding soup had two tiny meatballs and about 1/3 cup of celery. The meal in general was a total disaster, but we ordered dessert anyway, and the tiramisu was still partially frozen. Then the bill came to over $82.  

We could not believe that we'd enjoyed the lunch buffet so completely, which was only $7.95, and that this dinner, as overpriced as it already was, was so completely void of flavor and character. 

It's baffling to comprehend that an Italian restaurant that's been around as long as they have would still survive with these prices and total lack of quality for dinner. We had gone in with such high hopes.  But honestly, for dinner, it was such a huge let-down, we'll never go back. We'll go to the lunch buffet, but never to dinner. It was truly, truly just plain sad."	review	tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 3, u'plain': 10, u'writer': 22, u'note': 12, u'hot': 14, u'cool': 22}	[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, 9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA, RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA, 6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew, op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q, jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw, SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	William	118	user	{u'funny': 195, u'useful': 457, u'cool': 162}	2011-08
179	vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q	2011-10-19	HGOARXt-EyFcMRK8DZgTtw	2	"I have to preface this review with two factors. One, I moved here from South Florida, where the best burgers in town came from your average diners.  They were the last bastion of American food in South Florida, so they served up REAL American food.  If you wanted a real burger, you went to a diner.  After returning to Pittsburgh, I found that every diner here has turned to serving up those frozen gray hockey puck patties and passing them off as burgers.

Second, (until the recent explosion of good burger joints in da burgh), I actually HAD been a fan of Tessaro's, until their hostess/manager flat out offended the hell out of me and my party of three.  The result is that I have never, and WILL never return to Tessaro's.

My best friend is a 62 y/o blind woman that I met doing theater in the 90's in Pittsburgh.  She lives with her 91 year old mother, and her father (the driver) passed away several years ago.  I don't drive, and rely on the bus system that Steve Bland is intentionally systematically destroying, so any outing that we make must be carefully planned.

She and I had met once at Tessaro's.  It was her first time being there.  She took the Access van for the disabled, and I met her there after work via bus.  I walked in, she was seated, having a drink, waiting for me to join her. No problem.  We had a great meal, with an awesome burger.  I can't say enough...they really do have mouthwatering burgers.

Months later, we decided to go again, and the plan was pretty much the same.  She took the Access van to the restaurant, and I was going to meet her by bus, and this time a new friend was going to join us, coming by bus from Oakland, and new to Pittsburgh.

My best friend called me at 4:30 (we were supposed to meet at 5) and said that her van had come early, and that she was already at the restaurant.  I told her I would get there as soon as I could.  I left work a few minutes before 5 pm, and arrived at the restaurant 5:15.  They were busy, but I was surprised to find my friend still standing in the doorway.  The blind woman had been standing there for 45 minutes.  

I made my presence known, and the hostess/manager acknowledged, asked about our other friend. I explained that he was ten minutes away and coming by bus, new to the city, but WAS on his way.  She walked away from us.  We stood in the doorway fro another twenty minutes.

Finally, the manager came back, and I caught her attention, and motioned my head toward my blind friend, and asked if we really had to keep waiting?  She'd been standing there in the doorway for over an hour.

The next statement sealed the deal on us never returning to Tessaro's.  The manager slapped her hands on her hips, and started barking:

""LOOK!  We don't have many rules around here!  In fact, we only have ONE, that you don't get seated until your whole party is here!""

And THIS is what really sealed it:

The woman thrust her thumb in my BLIND friend's direction, who had only been to Tessaro's ONCE before in her life, with me, and said:

""And SHE oughta KNOW that!""

She oughta know that?  Exactly HOW should she 'know that'? The only other time she'd been there, she arrived before me, was seated, waited, and I joined her.

Additionally, the 'rule' was posted...on a piece of 8 1/2 by 11 copy paper, taped to the wall at the end of the counter, behind several rows of water pitchers.  I couldn't see the 'rule'...a blind woman certainly wasn't going to 'see' it!

Finally, after another ten minutes standing there, the manager 'allowed' us to take a table and wait for our friend, who came five minutes later.  We ate our meal, paid our bill, and we left.

And we will NOT return.

You can treat me badly, and if there's something I really love about your business, I might come back.  But do NOT badmouth a blind woman, or anyone else for that matter, who is disabled, and in need of a slight amount of extra consideration.

Tessaro's, you might make good burgers, and you'll continue making a fortune off them.  And I'm sure you really don't give a crap about how your manager treated this lady.  But we will NOT drop one dime more in your restaurant.  We'll take our business to Burgatory."	review	tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 7, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 3, u'plain': 10, u'writer': 22, u'note': 12, u'hot': 14, u'cool': 22}	[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, 9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA, RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA, 6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew, op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q, jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw, SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	William	118	user	{u'funny': 195, u'useful': 457, u'cool': 162}	2011-08
180	9VtaTbTKVK9sQVy4j2RO-w	2014-07-04	DaOl8dJEggFs0akZx_nljw	4	"Ok kids, come on...the place isn't called 'El Bistro de' anything, nor will you find it under any Zagat listings. It isn't located on the Riviera, or anywhere near Shadyside or any other trendy nose-in-the-air (which is STILL laughable in Pittsburgh) acceptable neighborhood. It's in Blawnox, and it's called Bob's GARAGE...

Bob's isn't the penthouse lounge at the Carlton...it's a neighborhood bar. And as a neighborhood bar goes...with the karaoke...it was actually a very pleasant little joint to hang out in for an evening with friends and sing our guts out.

YES...they still allow smoking...YES, people drink well drinks there...and yes, the food has gluten in it and probably comes out of a freezer bag.

Gordon Ramsey didn't rescue the joint, and the decorating most likely involves sales at Party City and a hot glue gun.

Bob's Garage does not pretend to be anything that it isn't. Wanna pretend? Go hang at a Big Burrito joint, or dial up Kevin Sousa. Bob's is a funky and cool little joint to hang out in with a group of pretty decent people, all ages, who are out for an evening of a few drinks (I saw no drunks) being served by a bartender who was very friendly and helpful, in a location that does kind of look like Pool City exploded during Christmas time and landed in the middle of Party City during high season. It's comfortable, laid back, and the karaoke guy on Thursdays, John, was very kind and friendly, and did his karaoke like a pro. He also had a very nice singing voice himself. He didn't rip apart his karaoke singers like another 'Oke' leader in the burgh, who mostly caters to the gay bars.

The other revelers that night were in a range from very good to ouch, but the atmosphere is such that if you can't carry a tune in a bucket...sooooooo what. People clap, and allow you to have a good time.

I can't say I'd ever look at this place from the outside and say 'HEY - let's try it for lunch!' Or dinner for that matter. 

But for a fun evening just hanging with friends in an unpretentious atmosphere, and jumping up to sing...bring it on. The drinks aren't terribly overpriced, and no one is looking down on your for what you're wearing, or how badly you sound on a microphone. The more, the merrier.

My only suggestion would be for the karaoke guys to bring back the 'books'. I know that everyone is staring into their palms on their smart phones these days, but really...not EVERYONE. And we had a very hard time scanning a songbook online when the signals were weak and the batteries were draining on the cell phones.

And to be honest - for the smoke whiners - maybe they've upped the ventilation since the last reviews were written, but even though I smoke, I generally hate smoking indoors. And I didn't walk out with the usual smoking bar sensation of having a nicotine trail follow me home.

Bottom line, if you're regular ol' folk, and would like a comfy location to have some fun with other regular ol' folk...park it in the Garage. Bob's Garage.

ADDENDUM: Went back for a second dose on a Friday night, and had just as great a time. The difference was that we tried the food. I had a Reuben and my friends had a fish sandwich and the other a steak. Reasonable prices, not uppity gourmet, and not horrible. Just plain ol' decent bar food."	review	tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ	{u'funny': 8, u'useful': 10, u'cool': 7}	3.52	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 3, u'plain': 10, u'writer': 22, u'note': 12, u'hot': 14, u'cool': 22}	[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, 9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA, RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA, 6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew, op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q, jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw, SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	William	118	user	{u'funny': 195, u'useful': 457, u'cool': 162}	2011-08
181	bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A	2013-06-21	9SA1wkmCMUmw1vZWlMQo-g	3	"For years...and I mean YEARS, I've heard of it, avoided it, and never had the least curiosity about it. It seemed like a waste of a ginormous building, and hype, hype, hype.  Plus, not being a beer drinker at ALL, the 'Brew' part certainly wasn't going to draw me in. But this past week, someone that I've been playing dueling restaurants with took me to Church Brew Works to see what it was all about.

Well, I guess it's pretty cool, if you're a tourist, a beer drinker, or don't mind busting a bank account on one meal.

The atmosphere is kind of cool in a kitschy way. Take a building once used to drain the soul, and turn it over to something that FEEDS the soul (or at least the liver). Not only is the enormous brew machinery on the altar a very cool replacement for bleeding martyrs, but it finally gives da burgh the centerpiece of worship that is befitting them. In addition to the apse-de-brew, all of the seating has been created from the old pews. Even the menus reflect old church programs.

Speaking of atmosphere and menus...I don't eat atmosphere, as I've pointed out in many other reviews. I ultimately go to an eatery to EAT. So after five minutes of taking in the 'atmosphere', I delved into the menu to make a selection.

I wasn't terribly impressed with the offerings, and I definitely was not impressed with the prices. If I end up planning my meal according to the menu prices, I've gone to the wrong place. And that is pretty much exactly what happened. We both chose a steak with cheesy potatoes and a corn salad, that was in the $15 range. My friend chose the 'beer sampler', which was like ten small glasses of beer that were supposed to be drunk in a specific order.  So our order was placed, and now on to sucking in more 'atmosphere'.

And I DO have to say that whoever places the orders for the wait studs in this place has impeccable taste in dark featured hunky real looking men. I was ready to take communion at any moment, or study up on what it means to be an altar boy.

Ok, atmosphere over, on to the food. The steak was cooked the way I liked it, and was very tender and flavorful. The cheesy potatoes, which I firmly believe are the leftovers from stuffing home made pierogis, was very pleasant and tasty as well. The corn salad, I could have used a few more words on the menu, or a heads up as to what all was in it, as onions are not my friend. I also think they could use a little better aim when putting it on the plate, or not use it as a sauce to top everything else on the plate, which seems to be what the aim was. I really didn't need the corn salad on the steak, or even dribbling over the potatoes. 

On the whole, except for the potential acid reflux from the surprise onions, the meal was satisfying and pretty good. 

Then came the dessert menu, and my friend opted for coconut cheesecake, and I had the tiramisu.  The tiramisu itself was great. My suggestion would be to drop the kind of fakey tasting chocolate poo blobs decorating the plate. They did nothing to enhance the flavor of the tiramisu, which would have been absolutely perfect by itself.

Our waitress was very friendly and helpful, the meal was good, and my friend liked most of his beer (with ten of them, it's naturally going to be hit or miss). The atmosphere was pleasant and not TOO over the top 'sports bar' video screenage, and the eye candy just kept walking back and forth.

But once again, I am drawn back to the high pricing, which is what will prevent me from becoming a regular. I'm not even a fan of being treated when the prices are that high. And as I said...if I'm choosing my meal by price more than by desire...I'm in a FTLT situation.

I can see how the place would appeal to a tourist, or to a black and gold anniversary dinner.  But as a regular haunt...not so much."	review	tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 3, u'plain': 10, u'writer': 22, u'note': 12, u'hot': 14, u'cool': 22}	[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, 9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA, RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA, 6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew, op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q, jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw, SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	William	118	user	{u'funny': 195, u'useful': 457, u'cool': 162}	2011-08
182	QHI_sBKISzQsDMp2cXBXjQ	2013-04-09	56VlCrLPMxX3czgRi5FL_Q	4	"I LOVE a good fish sandwich. With the emphasis on GOOD. Now I've heard all of the raves and seen all of the signs bragging about such-n-such an establishment's FAMOUS fish sandwich. Armand's FAMOUS fish sandwich. Wholey's FAMOUS fish sandwich. Roland's FAMOUS fish sandwich. And for years, I've driven past the dingy looking hole-in-the-wall with the neon sign out front 'Nied's Hotel' (which kind of looked like the dive bar my father worked at and found his second woman to knock up), with the 'Famous Fish Sandwich' sign...yadda yadda yadda.

Then, this particularly boring Tuesday evening, with foiled plans for something else, a neighbor and I decided to grab a bite. 'Let's try a fish sandwich at Nied's' I said. And off we went. 

My hopes weren't real high, having experienced far too many disappointments in da burgh, mostly due to a big ol' dead fish on a hamburger bun. SERIOUSLY people, you're not fooling anyone. Just because you plop a big ol' fish on a tiny bun, it doesn't make the fish look bigger. It just makes the sandwich tedious to eat. Six bites of 'sandwich', and a plate of leftover fish that will NEVER fit on a hamburger bun.

So we entered the darkened cave of Nied's Hotel, which really was kind of an ancient but charming 'dive bar' with a restaurant on the side. We scoped the menus briefly - burgers, doggies, chicken, seafood, sides, and - the famous fish sandwich (with or without cheese). We knew what we came for, and we ordered. 

It took almost no time to arrive, and our waitress was a good ol' kind of hometown gal, very friendly and accommodating, and happy to see 'new faces' coming in to give it a try.

Well...I have to say, after five years of just driving by and wondering...it was more than worth the visit.  The fish was large, flavorful (not fishy tasting like something that had washed ashore in the noon day sun), the breading was nicely firm and crisp, not too heavy and not too light, and the flavor of overused oil did NOT come into the flavor. The cheese was a couple of sliced of basic American cheese, and I asked for lettuce and tomato, which fit nicely on...THE BUN.

Ok, now I'm not going to rave (or rant) about the bun except to say that of ALL of the joints in town serving a fish sandwich, Nied's came closest to having a bun to kind of fit FISH appropriately. It wasn't a freakin' hamburger bun! It was a longer roll (still not long enough to fit a fish), and made a little more sense as a bun for a fish sandwich than most brainiacs in da burgh seem capable of conjuring up.

Hmmmmm. Up until now, my fave fish sandwich in town, somewhat appropriately, was at the Lesbian bar in Lawrenceville. But now, I have to say, Nied's has won me over.

Armand's can keep the feisty old lady and the greasy fish on a hamburger bun. Wholey's can keep their claficken (and if you didn't know, since everything seems fried in the same vat, that meat you're eating, whether clams, fish, or chicken, all tastes the same...claficken). When I'm now in the mood for a good bar fish sandwich...it'll be Nied's.

And, to top it all off, they have BOTH - Coke AND Pepsi! (now truly, how smart is that?)

The waitress was bragging about her Reuben special on Tuesdays. I'm going to take her up on that challenge. I LOOOOOOVE a good Reuben, but have yet to find one ANYWHERE in da burgh that can stand up to the least of a Reuben from New York. I go to NY for four days, 6 of my eight meals are Reubens, because I know that ANYWHERE I go in NYC, competition and a demand for excellence insists - ANY Reuben had better be a damned GOOD Reuben, and they always are.

I'll be taking this gal up on the Reuben challenge. But even if it fails, the fish sandwich is worth the trip. 

Nied's is a prime example of the type of place I will repeatedly hit for food...I don't give a rat's patootie how much you spend on 'atmosphere' and glitz...I go for the food. And often, the best food is found in the least likely places. 

And frankly,  the 'famous' sign might actually be worthy of its braggage."	review	tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 3, u'plain': 10, u'writer': 22, u'note': 12, u'hot': 14, u'cool': 22}	[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, 9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA, RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA, 6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew, op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q, jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw, SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	William	118	user	{u'funny': 195, u'useful': 457, u'cool': 162}	2011-08
183	dVf7896SPwE8jEenEhI6Pg	2012-04-24	Rs6v01QMxMwieJIN5YJv8A	4	"If you're looking for good, old-fashioned Italian 'food' served in heaping mounds for a reasonable price - Big Jim's should be THE place to go.

I first learned of Big Jim's many, many years ago, when a friend introduced me to this hidden gem.  Some changes have been made since that era, but nothing for the worse.  They used to be a very closed-in smoking establishment, but the new laws have stopped that, and the result is that you can eat without watching the nicotine drip from the walls.  I'm a smoker, but the atmosphere used to be even too thick for me to fully enjoy.  But even then, the food made it worth the trip.

Big Jim's is a divey bar/restaurant tucked into a hidden corner of Greenfield that they call 'the run'. It is by far, nothing fancy. Wood paneled walls, framed tacky prints bearing scenes of Italy occasionally, or scenes of the burgh. Truly, nothing to look at.

TVs dot the rooms, usually playing local news, or of course, da game - whichever one happens to be playing. 

The service can be hit or miss - we're not talking high end customer service here. You may get an attitude from someone who looks like a mobile home park escapee, or you might get just efficient cordial service from someone who looks like a college student that Starbuck's wouldn't hire.  But really, that's not even important in this setting.

The gold mine that Big Jim's offers is very good food in jumbo portions, and at a truly reasonable price.  I've taken several out of towners to Big Jim's and rarely have they not gone home with leftovers in a take out box.

The pasta dishes are tasty and large, and most meals come with a side salad, or other side of your choice. Order something like lasagna or chicken or eggplant parmigiana, and you're either a Hoover in disguise, or you're taking some home.

The last time I visited, I saw a VERY large man in a Pitt sports outfit at the next table order a calzone.  It took a while to arrive, but when it did, the man's eyes nearly bugged out.  And he was a BIG football player type. The calzone truly looked like a large pizza folded in half. This ginormous sports machine - took half home. 

The appetizers are good. I recommend the fried zucchini planks, but everything I've had has been plentiful and tasty. I've eaten the lasagna (took half home) chicken parmigiana (took half home), eggplant parmigiana (took half home), the linguini with white clam sauce (ok, ate all of that), hot sandwiches, and more, and I've never been unfulfilled or disappointed.  They have gnocchi in a red sauce (I swear they used to have it in a creamy cheese sauce, but that seems to have disappeared from the menu - shame too, it was yum), and even have things for the non-Italian people, like cheesesteak sandwiches, open faced roast beef and  fries smothered with gravy.

Once again I say - I am NOT a 'foodie'.  I like FOOD.  And Big Jim's is a place that can fill you up and not rip you off.

Two enormous entrees usually coming with a side, a soda, an appetizer or two, and a meal for the next day's lunch - the bill usually comes to just under $30.

It's a hidden gem - so get out your mapquest or GPS - and find it!"	review	tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 3, u'plain': 10, u'writer': 22, u'note': 12, u'hot': 14, u'cool': 22}	[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, 9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA, RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA, 6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew, op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q, jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw, SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	William	118	user	{u'funny': 195, u'useful': 457, u'cool': 162}	2011-08
184	NTuAHWEaVCZvSF7owONQ8A	2012-09-17	2EPhkof6tH9GpFFpTbpeCA	5	"It is really hard to base a review on a theater company's entire body of work on having seen one show, but if this production is an accurate representation of the quality of work overall, then this is one of the rare theater companies in Pittsburgh that is not only worth watching, but worth paying their ticket price for.

For several years now, I've been accompanying my best friend to her season subscription at the Public Theatre, and have been extremely let down by the quality of the productions, As someone commented on my review of the Public, it is duller than drying paint beige theater.

The very first play I saw at Pittsburgh Irish and Classical was electric, but in the few years I've occasionally attended their other productions, they've been very hot and cold, and their very name restricts the kind of theater productions that they can do. And it's not always worth the exorbitant ticket prices they charge.

But I signed up for the e-mails from the Pittsburgh Playhouse (which is about the ONLY way to learn about theater productions here - sign up for EACH theater's e-mails - because no one seems to do much marketing beyond that, and the local media certainly doesn't help much for the local arts) and saw that they were presenting 'August: Osage County'...and that the tickets were $24. So we decided to give them a try.

And we're damned glad that we did. This was a top notch VERY high production value presentation, of a superbly written and award laden script.

The casting was local, and the cream of the crop of local actors. The set was beautiful and functional, and the direction gave the play the exact spark and airborn sizzle that live theater often misses out on in Pittsburgh. This was a three act LONG play that didn't have us nodding off after 40 minutes...which I can NOT say for the 90 minute no-intermission plays that I've seen at the Public. 

I will also say that the local casting wasn't just a list of 'Equity' professionals, with a few Point Park or CMU students as low-budget 'filler'. Every role on that stage was performed by someone who knew what they were doing, and they all did it perfectly well.

As I mentioned, hard to base an entire body of work on seeing one play - but if this one play is an accurate representation, then this is a theater to get on their e-mail list - and with their affordable ticket prices, it's not so 'scary' to take a chance on their productions. 

The only downfall is the location, which has been pretty much forgotten by the Pittsburgh 'development' geniuses, except of course for UPMC, which has surrounded the one time 'arts' block with behemoth medical facilities. There is limited parking nearby, and there is absolutely nothing to eat within walking distance. Not so problematic if you have a car, but not so easy to plan anything else if you rely on public transportation, or in my friend's case, the Access vans for the disabled. They do have a cafe of sorts, but it's pretty much a generic Starbuck's without the Starbuck's.

The theater is ancient. I was there two hundred years ago as a child, and it really looks at though nothing has been changed in the auditorium (except of course the name, which now bears the name of the most recent wealthy donor) since I was there in fourth grade. But that's what an old theater SHOULD be. For me, a true live theater LOVER, it isn't about the atmosphere, it's about the quality of what I'm watching AND paying for. 

This was a locally produced play worth paying for, a rarity in da burgh. And we look forward to exploring further!"	review	tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ	{u'funny': 3, u'useful': 6, u'cool': 4}	3.52	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 3, u'plain': 10, u'writer': 22, u'note': 12, u'hot': 14, u'cool': 22}	[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, 9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA, RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA, 6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew, op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q, jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw, SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	William	118	user	{u'funny': 195, u'useful': 457, u'cool': 162}	2011-08

The food that I'd had had frankly been somewhat impressive, even for delivery, which I'm discovering in da burgh, tends to lean toward the 'let's skimp a bit' side. It was last summer, so I can't remember everything we'd ordered, but I do recall a pasta dish with seafood that was actually a healthy portion, as well as very creamy and tasty, with some nice plump shrimp.

So this past weekend, with an old high school friend in from out of town, after already having eaten a big lunch, then sitting through a movie, we were peckish at the dinner hour. We initially wanted to try the Conflict Kitchen, but they were closed on a Sunday for the dinner hour, so we drove a few blocks over and started to hunt, and I thought 'Hey, let's give Fuel & Fuddle a physical try!'.

We were met at the door by an absolutely delightful young gal named 'Morgan', who was not only greeting us at the door, but she was actually there to OPEN the door for us. She took us to a table, gave us our menus, and returned in mere moments to take our drink order - Coke products - thank GOODNESS - our lunch choice, a Mexican restaurant, only had Pepsi (or Pessi, as they put it) products, and by dinner I was seriously Jonesing for a DC. Morgan assured me that she'd keep the glass full and she did.

Since we weren't up for a full meal, the decision was made by my friend, after minimal suggestion, that dinner needed to be WINGS and CHOCOLATE. So we split an order of Garlic Parmesan wings, and then split a Big Assed Brownie. 

The wings were very good, plump and juicy and flavorful, served with Ranch Dressing, and the ten of them sated our small appetites just fine. 

However, Morgan was a trooper, and the kitchen was extremely accommodating when I asked a special favor. When we'd ordered for delivery, I had been dying of curiosity about their Alligator Stew. I'd had my Gator Bites when living in Florida, but had never had gator meat in a stew. Every time we ordered, they ended up being out of the stew, so I'd never gotten to try it. Now, we were in no position to devour a full meal, but I still wanted to try it. So I asked if they might be willing to part with just a sample for future reference, IF they had any. Morgan checked, and the kitchen obliged with a small bowl of the mashed potatoes covered with a small sampling of the gator stew. It also has chicken and sausage in it, but they were easily recognized. The gator was tender and flavorful as well. Morgan said she'd never try it. I may have convinced her to step out of the black and gold box and take one bite...to expand her horizons. The stew really is very good. And come on...like everything else that people think is too weird to try...tastes like chicken. Well, ok, not really. It tastes more like pork with the texture of soft ground beef.

Next up came the dessert. Cindy ate the one of the brownies and a few bites of the ice cream, and took the second brownie home, and I just picked at the ice cream. It was perfectly fine for what it was. A big assed brownie with ice cream, walnuts and chocolate sauce. 

The crowd WAS very young, and had it been packed with this age group, I probably would have opted to move on, but being that it was summer and a Sunday, it was not packed, and therefor tolerable.

Morgan thanked us profusely for being so nice, to the point that I can only imagine what she might go through with her 'regular' crowd. And that would be the crowd I'd try to avoid.

But for an off-season evening, it was a very pleasant experience. The food was good, the atmosphere pleasant, the service perfect, and the price was decent.

And they definitely have a few variations on the menu that I'd like to go back and try when I'm up for an actual dinner.

There was no Fuddle, but plenty of Fuel.

Good job, and thank you Morgan."	review	tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 3, u'plain': 10, u'writer': 22, u'note': 12, u'hot': 14, u'cool': 22}	[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, 9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA, RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA, 6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew, op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q, jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw, SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	William	118	user	{u'funny': 195, u'useful': 457, u'cool': 162}	2011-08
186	q_2HooHFCE9wAwmXQPkuyg	2012-07-08	w8ixoRTM_RORrmFtKkjFeQ	3	"After a double feature Sunday afternoon at The Manor Theatre, my best friend and I went for our usual dinner prowl.  We considered Indian, but it was a little far to walk, and then basically tossed a coin between Aladdin's and the Bangkok Balcony. Aladdin's won.

The interior atmosphere was huge and very pleasant, and the staff was actually very nice and accommodating.

The menu was pretty extensive, offering a lot of pita rolls, salads, soups, appetizers, entrees, and dinners, ranging from vegetarian to unusual, to the usual Middle-Eastern fare.

I ordered a Diet Coke, and my friend ordered the Pomegranate Green tea.  According to her, the tea was not only delicious, but incredibly fragrant.

For our dinners, we each ordered a variation on one dish, so we could try them both. They involved a plate of hummous topped with meat (I had chicken, she had beef) with some bits of tomato and parsley, with a basket of Pita on the side.  We also ordered a side of the rice vermicelli with pine nuts just to check it out.

The chicken was ok, lightly seasoned chicken thigh, cut into very small cubes. The beef was more seasoned and flavorful, and in bigger strips.

I can't say that I was very impressed with their self-proclaimed 'famous' hummous. No garlic, no lemon, no olive oil flavors at all. Just chick peas and tahini, that's all that could be tasted, and it was a BIG plate of it.

The pita was fine, and actually came abundantly enough to cover the ginormous portion of hummous.

The rice and vermicelli was adequate. Tasty, but not spectacular, and the pine nuts lingered with me for the rest of the evening.

I didn't realize that Aladdin's was a chain, or we might have thought twice about it.  I can't say it was awful, but I certainly can't praise it. I've definitely had more taste bud tripping Middle-Eastern food.  We were also kind of surprised to learn that they don't have any kind of Arabic or Turkish coffee on the beverage menu. 

Huh?

Now I know we didn't branch out much with choices from the menu, but to me, if something as basic a Middle-Eastern staple as hummous doesn't come with much flavor, I'd actually be concerned about ordering other 'typical' dishes.

The bill came to just over $30 for the basic meal we had, and overall, I was not impressed enough to go a second time.  The space is pretty, the staff is uber-friendly (and the two Middle-Eastern guys sitting across from us were absolutely delicious to look at during the meal) but the prices were a little high for the product, and the product just didn't hit the spot as fulfilling.  Ali-Baba on Craig Street has a more limited menu - but the flavors are far better."	review	tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 3, u'plain': 10, u'writer': 22, u'note': 12, u'hot': 14, u'cool': 22}	[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, 9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA, RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA, 6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew, op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q, jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw, SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	William	118	user	{u'funny': 195, u'useful': 457, u'cool': 162}	2011-08
187	QGWyhvvLjaT1Szw-segoOg	2012-09-22	ElunFODXY2lwcQiGdzZ2dg	2	"So, the Eat N Park company decided to renovate the Squirrel Hill shop.  They spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to make the place look hip and trendy, with high tables and chairs, garage door windows to allow for opening and closing during the nicer seasons to 'open air' the place. They spent money on new art that shows the neighborhood. The gave the facade a facelift with stone and paint, and cut the place in half to create another bistroid on what used to be the left side of the seating area. 

Everything is new. New counters and display cases, new carpeting, regular chairs and tables, and upholstered booths. New lighting fixtures. There's even a TV for - well - yet MORE sports coverage in da burgh.

On the wall between the restrooms is a huge banner boasting of how much money they've given to local charities annually. If I recall correctly, the amount was around $2 Million.

So they have money to spend on new restaurants, like Porch, an overstated atmospheric case of overpriced mediocrity, and whatever this new bistroid is that's next to the old but new Eat N Park. They have money to renovate the Eat N Park into an apparent trendy high end diner. They have enough money to donate $2 Million to charity.

But dear Eat N Park...what about the FOOD?

Generally, the only reason my friend and I go to Eat N Park is to grab the breakfast buffet before an afternoon of movies.  Which we did this morning, and what did we find?

A big fancy renovation - with the same ol' crappy food.

Scrambled eggs out of a carton that would make a World War II military man feel right at home. Rubbery pancakes. The same out-of-a-can cheese sauce for whatever you wanted to ladle it over. The same flavorless sausage gravy for dried out biscuits. Sausage greasy enough to lube your 1957 Buick. And they can't even be bothered with the little potato pancakes that used to actually be kind of yummy. One the first trip to the buffet, they had maybe six potato-pancake-like chunks left in the pan, and when we came back for more, they'd switched to regular hash browns patties that had been cut into squares. Same ol' dry mini-muffins. Same ol' canned fruit. Even the 'sauteed' mushrooms were nearly raw and dry, barely cooked at all, let alone 'sauteed'.

I found humor in the fact that they now try to sell their own bags of coffee along with the smiley cookies in the dessert counter, when the coffee that comes to the table is pretty much brown water, that my friend and I refer to as 'tea-fee'.

Eat N Park is (correct me if I'm wrong) SUPPOSED to be a 'restaurant'.  And in my opinion, a restaurant should be know for its...well...FOOD.

Now I have learned, especially as decades passed and corners were cut for profits (which they are apparently making, considering the new bistroids, the renovations, and the charity work) NOT to expect much in the way of 'food' from an Eat N Park. They didn't nick-name it 'Eat N Puke' for nothing. 

However, like most corporate entities in our country today...if you're going to show off and brag about your 'profits', it had BETTER be reflected in your product! 

You may have given the visuals a stunning make-over. And yeah, it's pretty. However, in the rejuvenation of your brand and your product, it's another epic FAIL.

Because in the end (literally) it's the same garbage you've been passing off as 'food' for the last twenty years. The only thing the facelift has inspired is perhaps the change of the apt nick-name...from Eat N Puke...to maybe 'Masticate N Regurgitate'.

Serioulsy? It's too expensive to crack actual eggs, mix in some milk and whip them to make scrambled eggs? It's too expensive to throw potatoes in a food processor with some eggs, flour and seasonings to make your own potato pancakes?

But we can afford a real stone facade, and $2 Million to charity.

188	fHfKprgE_HqMcwxuZzBqLA	2013-01-18	ctIKcxmJCuwmh9dHLvkL5Q	4	"Wait! What? What's THIS? A REAL 'diner' downtown???

Three months new to working downtown again, and I've been searching high and low within walking distance for food. On a daily basis, I walked past this little place and barely looked at it. The front door is recessed, no windows, and certainly looked like nothing fancy...in fact, it didn't look like anything at all.

Then one Friday, I started thinking about that Friday Fish Sandwich, and asked around the office for where I might be able to find a GOOD one nearby. A couple of folks said that I might try Hanlon's, and I said 'Where's that?"" When they told me, I said 'There's a restaurant there?'

So I headed off in the direction of the place I'd passed every day getting to and from the bus, and voila...there it was...in all it's diner glory. Well, kind of like a diner cave. The sandwich board out front advertised the jumbo fish sandwich with fries for $6.99. What the hey, and in I went.

Wow! An inner sanctum of greasy spoon diner, just exactly what a greasy spoon diner should be! Naugahyde booths in two rows, an uber long lunch counter, a lot of people, a handful of real-people waitresses, and a handful of cute regular guys working the line. 

I ordered my fish sandwich to go, paid, and off to the office. 

Pretty damned good fish sandwich (although again on a hamburger bun - seriously Pittsburgh) and a LOT of fish. Good quality fish, decent breading, fried just right. Decent fries. Worth a return trip. Could this be the normalcy I've been seeking?

Even tried the Reuben once, and not bad. I'm a Reuben fanatic, and can easily have four to six Reuben meals in a four day trip to NY, just because I KNOW, regardless of where I get it, it's going to be GOOD - and I've yet to find one in da burgh to rival ANY NY Reuben - but for a Pittsburgh attempt at a Reuben, Hanlon's didn't completely disappoint. 

Then came the no-carb diet, and a lack of food in my house, which forced me into meat and cheese omelet land. Not only were they accommodating with the no potato, no toast request, but after dumping styrofoam into the trash every day in the office, I decided to take in my own container to be green. They were even glad to help there. And...good omelet, filled with meaty bits of bacon, ham, and sausage, gooey cheese, and I do believe real eggs, not poured-from-a-carton eggs.

Went to a meeting there about some banking stuff, and me and a friend and a financial adviser all had a very satisfying diner meal.  The only issue I had that day, never having actually eaten 'there', was that my clothes, including my coat, pretty much smelled like a french fry for the rest of the week.  Well, that and the financial advise issue...

But all in all, this to me is exactly what a diner SHOULD be, reminding me of Jimmy's East Side Diner in Miami. A friendly neighborhood greasy spoon, with a good heap of food, decent prices, an effective and totally unpretentious staff that is friendly and kind, AND they have both Coke AND Pepsi products! Pepsi from the sludge machine, and Coke kept fresh in the sweet cans in the cooler!

A co-worker loves their buffalo chicken strips and fries. And I do have to say, once off the diet, I'll be heading back for some fish - I was hooked.

The prices are very reasonable as well. But friends, it's NOT the Grand Concourse (thank goodness) - it's a diner.  And if anyone out there is confused by what a real diner is supposed to be like - listen up...""Hanlon's"". Ritter's has cut so many corners, that it's virtually child proof, and Tom's 'diner'? Listen to the song by Suzanne Vega - it's tastier and more satisfying.

I just wish a place like this would actually do the real-city diner thing (other than Ritters) and be open 24 hours. 

I am a fan of Hanlon's...hands down.

189	d3ni6cKglu4L3JeveOqQDQ	2012-06-29	lrOg3KA2Z6tQoDCkkur1fg	3	"Went dinner hunting after a matinee at the Pittsburgh Irish and Classical Theatre, and after a disappointing brunch that morning at Porch, we decided to venture toward Craig Street. Ali Baba was out, since we'd had Middle Eastern the day before, and the Indian places were all closed or under renovation.  So, after a long day, we just decided to plop them at Union Grille.

Because of the early hour, it was reasonably quiet, and the cute little guy behind the bar seated us, and within a few moments our waitress came to the table for drink orders. 

My friend had experience with Union Grille and knew exactly what she wanted, so I took a few minutes to scan the menu.  There wasn't a whole lot jumping out at me, all being pretty basic American fare, so I opted just to give their burger a try. The menu listing had enough bells and whistles to make it seem like the most amazing thing since the first cow died, and being a total burger whore, why not.

The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time, and Ilene had the five hour pot roast. It is a slow cooked pot roast with mashed potatoes and some kind of very red gravy, and a side of the veggie of the day, and this day brought fresh green beans.  The portion was enormous, and a healthy dose of it was taken home. Just be very careful how you hold it. It's juicy. It leaks. But it was thoroughly enjoyable, and enough for two meals.

My burger was large. Before mine arrived, I saw a burger being delivered at the far end of the restaurant, and from across the room it looked ginormous, and it was pretty darned big up close as well.  And it wasn't all just a big fluffy bun. I also saw the beef from across the room.  The burger was cooked to order properly, nicely brown on the outside, and bloody pink on the inside...the kind than runs down your arm upon biting into it. The toppings were plentiful, and the bun wasn't too big or too small. Instead of the waffle fries, I ordered the mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy, and was a little disappointed. There was something just odd about the texture and flavor of the mashed potatoes, and the gravy seemed a little on the pre-fab side.  Even though the waitress insisted that the potatoes were so real that the guys in the kitchen hated making them, my tongue still got the feeling of chem spuds. That kind of consistently slightly grainy texture and not so potato taste that usually comes in styro with KFC printed on the side, but in this case came with a hint of garlic as a disguise. They may say 'real', but my tongue had serious doubts.

The burger was good, but being that said burger whore, it didn't come close to Winghart's or Burgatory in actual flavor. It was large and filling, but it just filled a void instead of hitting a spot.

The prices were the usual, not extremely overpriced, but not inexpensive.  The service was attentive, and the atmosphere was ok. As I've said in a few other reviews - seriously people - those TVs DO come with other channels than just sports and news!

I wouldn't call this a go-out-of-my-way to eat there kind of spot, but if in the area, and all other choices are exhausted, it'll do without being absolutely disappointing."	review	tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 3, u'plain': 10, u'writer': 22, u'note': 12, u'hot': 14, u'cool': 22}	[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, 9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA, RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA, 6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew, op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q, jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw, SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	William	118	user	{u'funny': 195, u'useful': 457, u'cool': 162}	2011-08
190	RhOTBt7ISr2rhXisSMLTSw	2011-12-15	_oojsrSbwM5aQR6y9BwFrg	5	"I discovered Spice Island shortly after they'd opened in the 90's, and was blow away then.  A really unique and varied menu, featuring dishes from a variety of Asian Islands, with unbelievable reasonable prices, incredibly flavor, kind service, and a very unpretentious comfortable atmosphere.

I left duh-burgh in '99 and didn't return until 2007, and when I returned I was thrilled to see that there was one business of true quality and reasonability that had not changed one iota. They didn't jack up the prices, they didn't cut down the portions, heck, even the decor pretty much stayed the same.  The ONLY negative in the whole endeavor is that the eye candy level dropped substantially when the Burmese partner left the business (he was breathtaking, and an incredibly sweet guy).

I have tried many dishes here through the years, and I have yet to put a bite of bad food in my mouth.  Though I must admit, I have arrived at a 'usual' when I go here, simply because after being in many different cities, and a few other countries, one dish that I have NEVER seen anywhere else, even with a different name, is the Burmese Lat Toke.  It is a huge cold salad, primarily of noodles, with toasted garlic, cilantro, fried tofu, some carrot and Asian cabbage shavings, and a tamarind-fish sauce that has just a slight spicy bite to it (available without the fish and pepper bite for the weaker diners.)  It is the lightest and most uniquely flavorful 'salad' I have ever eaten, and I've never seen it anywhere else.  So that's become my Spice Island Staple.  I don't get out much, but if I was able to eat here more regularly, I would try many more things on the menu.  I have tried the curries, and the rices, and the pad Thai, and have never been disappointed.  

The appetizers are just that...appetizers.  They're small, but they are delicious.  The Samosa are one of my faves, as well as the fritters.  The last time I ate here, I gave something new a try, and had the deep fried hard boiled eggs with a tomato fish sauce...and they were delish!

They always have daily specials, and their teas of the day are well worth eschewing the usual Diet Coke for me.  They're flavorful, unique, and most importantly, real.

They seem to have a pretty strong staff turn-over, but I guess this to be expected in college land, as I've rarely seen the same waitstaff there more than twice, and that's only if I've managed to eat there twice in a six month period.

Honestly, I don't think this place gets raved about nearly enough in the local foodie media.  I guess because they aren't all flashy and bistroid, the media already gave them their fifteen minutes ten years ago.  BUT, Spice Island has maintained their integrity and consistency in those last ten plus years.

The REAL highlight of this little cozy hole-in-the-wall is that it's not going to wipe out your bank account, AND it's going to fill your stomach...with quality over garbage.  

Where else in duh-burgh are you going to treat two friends to appetizers, an entree each that is plentiful, with real brewed teas, and even maybe a dessert -  for under $40 -  that doesn't involve a name starting with 'Mc', or a bunch of over oversized black and gold jerseys belching at the grease trough?

The clientele is generally leaning a bit more toward the intellectual end of the scale, which makes for a very comfortable evening of food and friends.

191	Q4ULAiIE2qCA4RYplCTrUQ	2011-11-29	b6vhZB1bT-3bSWnw_Z5W0A	2	"Once upon a time...before profiteering became more important than product, there were a lot of good food items to be had.   Anyone remember when Twinkies or Ho Ho's actually tasted like food, and not like chemical compounds?

Well, the same applies to Primanti Brothers.

Once upon a time, there was a little sandwich shop in Pittsburgh that was trying very hard to be like the famous steak sandwich shops in Philly.  After all, Pittsburgh really wasn't (and still isn't) 'known' for anything other than dirty steel mills, followed closely by closed steel mills, and the mill workers who sat around waiting for them to reopen, even after they'd been torn down and the property turned into malls.

Primanti Brother at one time was a decent sandwich shop with a quirky gimmick.  They put your sides ON the sandwich.  Yes, you could get a steak sandwich piled high with your favorites...french fries and cole slaw...in addition to the usual lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and cheese.

As time rolled by, the restaurants sprang up in several locations around the city, primarily anywhere that there might be a mall nearby, or a bunch of drunks who really didn't care WHAT they were eating, and there even sprang up one of the shops in Ft. Lauderdale.

As the business grew, the Primanti Brothers started cutting corners to maximize profits.  The meat became nothing more than Steak-Ums, and they started adding everything under the sun that could be served on a bun to their menu to try to draw in more people.  A nice healthy chicken breast...grilled in the same grease as everything else and topped with fries and cole slaw. 

Now, anyone not from Pittsburgh should know...native Pittsburghers are not exactly known for having distinguished tastes...in anything.  In fact, people in Pittsburgh will stand and give a raving standing ovation and scream 'faaaaabulous'...for what most folks around the country in more metropolitan cities would say 'eh'.

Last year, I had jury duty.  The Pittsburgh Courthouse is located near one of the many Primanti grease pits.  I thought I'd try a fish sandwich since I was on a limited budget for the day, and time was too short to sit down in any other restaurant.

Greasy, didn't taste much like fish, the batter was soggy from the grease, the cheese clearly came in little squares from a plastic package, and even the tartar sauce couldn't make it more palatable.  My stomach felt rock laden the rest of the day.

More recently, a couple from San Francisco came into the store where I work, which is near one of the Primanti restaurants.  They'd heard all the hype, and had lunch.

The woman said to me: ""WHAT is up with Primanti?  Everyone kept telling us we had to have a Primanti while we were in Pittsburgh!""

She looked at me, rolled her eyes, stuck out her tongue and said:  ""Bleeech!""

I shrugged my shoulders and told her I agreed.

I guess we could say that Primanti is kind of the White Castle of Pittsburgh, only with more ""GOOOO Steelers"" - ambience.

It is best eaten after a drunken bender, when you aren't really hungry, but are the type to eat like you're at a trough after guzzling half a keg of beer.

Or...you think McD's is fine dining.

Don't buy the hype.  The gimmick of the fries and slaw on the sandwich doesn't make it a decent meal.  Just means you're gullible to local yokel advertising.  And sadly, there really isn't another thing in Pittsburgh that stands out."	review	tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 3, u'plain': 10, u'writer': 22, u'note': 12, u'hot': 14, u'cool': 22}	[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, 9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA, RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA, 6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew, op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, 8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q, jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw, SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	William	118	user	{u'funny': 195, u'useful': 457, u'cool': 162}	2011-08

It is right across the street from the Rankin Police Station. The menu has a wide selection, I really couldn't decide what I wanted but I went with the ribeye sandwich. I'm glad i did too. Huge sandwich! I added mushrooms, it was very flavorful. My boyfriend got the fish sandwich, he enjoyed it as well. Fast and friendly service.

I haven't seen it myself, but have known of this place for a while before my first visit in 2013.  It wasn't until my almost 80yo buddy, Mr. Italo Donatucci (world's coolest old Italian dude) brought me one of the best fish sandwiches I ever had that I became hooked!  I've had at least 10 since then, but only during the Lent season.  I gave my 5 rating based on the fish sandwich alone.  Try it without a bun also!  Either way you get 3 nice size pieces of fish equal to a pound.  You can have your choice of sides, but I always get the small mac n cheese for my side.  The staff is always really friendly and service is prompt.  It's in a rough neighborhood, but the Rankin police station is right across the street.  Almost every visit there I have seen police officers inside mingling with the locals or picking up lunch orders.  Soon I plan to make a visit that's not a Friday during Lent to try other menu items.	review	a0ULPTNi05w-BNVovVUz2w	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 4}	3.92	{u'funny': 15, u'plain': 11, u'writer': 1, u'note': 6, u'photos': 8, u'hot': 6, u'cool': 20}	[]	3	[-F_wcFSV-vEy6n1qgRcvLg, IRvRxAyXIB_ZZqt31j35eg, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, 2QV4KR18awb1hSwtnNVrPQ, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, gfsf_4WlRnfBzyfMv8gbfg, bNDkhTINlrrCQcAuVturHg, gsRCdfdu6XJDG7GcTDY0wQ, nrGEjpGtWlca5EjVViXFAg, Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg, N_cH3QA_eXXmnzz-nzEeKA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, z7nabrc4mp9CCYZbiBWTMg, -UVW9HX36ZcqZcCu2UFwOg, Fu4BvdX3xB4e0Mq1Xnd04A, eNzSkY0YWpWIr30ijzliZw, ylIgegaQaJOjL4_lH2EkFA, tU4ZODJvuIuM2IGBhA_Hxg, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, p9OvcIakpDoDXl0Lez5CJQ, hru2IDwSyN61sgWPtJw_hA, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, An71ujetEmmj_3CxTJHuNg, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, xpvpJB3DArM9zhb10Z1rvg, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, XwRyD7_pmXPugYH83fz7yA, kMARFlXEhLxU9N2Wi4miog, uvXs09fVId2GarZVJq-DMg, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, cR5LmdFO4Wu6W2phBSo2aw, tOm1mQutc-UW9H4ME1HToQ, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, xtv-RHo_mMjNq0oX7nRn7w, MSuyK2p8G9hEqyWf5IgnYQ, R4mbfT5hC3ZQZDWSZzNKgA, KWehgsTXybMvYM1-arNG9Q, bmSi7tRKdATgwfC2T7c1eQ, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	Sean	13	user	{u'funny': 12, u'useful': 25, u'cool': 25}	2013-11

We needed a large number of photos printed and my father had decided to go to FedEx. I can only imagine this decision because they're known for print quality. They should also be known for being cumbersome and overcharging. After an hour of struggling with their machines to print, we left. I suggested Target because we were in the area, and I halfway remembered that they used the Kodak app to develop pictures from your phone. 

As soon as we get in, it's always a win because pictures are 25¢, compared to 49¢ at their competitor. It was easy to sync up the photo library via wifi to the kiosk with the app. After choosing and modifying all of our pictures, we were given a slip stating our order of 63 pictures would be ready in 15 minutes. 

We picked up everything else we needed and checked out, finishing in 7 minutes. By then our photos were done and we checked out at the photo stand, paying less than half of what we anticipated paying at the other place. Plus the quality was fantastic, the photos weren't too glossy, and everything worked out perfectly.

The waiter even offered to deshell the lobster. We brought a cake for our friend and they took it back to the kitchen and cut it for us, put candles in it, brought it out and served it to us.

The office is clean (and expanding their space), very professional. Offer some of the latest in dental services. Run very close to schedule so there is no waiting, even though the waiting room is relaxing. The entire office has a modern approach and surpasses any other dentist I have been too. I travel 40-45 min to get to the office from my home but it is worth it to me.	review	FoFdGS2TjVUUXptBS_gdNQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.31	{u'plain': 1}	[]	0	[]	Tricia	13	user	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 5, u'cool': 3}	2013-03

I emailed them about how awful my wings (5 tiny wings for 6.95), as well as my turkey bacon wrap (8.95) was. Told that I would get a refund and a gift card. Never heard from them again. In fact - I bought lunch for all my employees and no one liked their food. I work for a large company in south side & can guarantee you that we will not be returning. I had also previously dined in before and was displeased with the cocky attitude from the waiter.	review	FoFdGS2TjVUUXptBS_gdNQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.31	{u'plain': 1}	[]	0	[]	Tricia	13	user	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 5, u'cool': 3}	2013-03

The food is delicious (yes yes, the fish sandwiches, OK, I agree -- but DID YOU TRY THE MEATBALLS?? holy tamoley), I adore the staff, and I love that there are no windows -- it's its own little hermetically sealed 1950s world of delicious, real food and good people. Lots of places try to create this kind of ambiance, but it can't be manufactured. It takes decades of good food and good vibes.

Also, the food is really good. :)"	review	E5O8wsWiGLqoOVBmG84wcw	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	4.2	{}	[]	0	[]	Della	11	user	{u'funny': 7, u'useful': 10, u'cool': 2}	2008-12

The agent that I have worked with from the start, whose name I think is Heather (long dark hair, second desk from the left), has always been willing to spend as much time with me as I needed to understand what I was buying and/or the process that I needed to go through.

Also, my car was totaled a couple of years ago (some jagoff who was texting rear-ended me, ahem, please don't do this), and they were phenomenal. I had a check for the full amount in less than a week.

I see a lot of negative reviews here for services that are title related. I don't know if those people are even AAA employees, they might be DOT for all we know. I've had three title transactions, including one for a car that was from out of state, and they all went smoothly.

My appointment was at 5pm, they took me back, and I got to watch while he did the hard sell on this poor girl who was sitting there with wet hair and half a haircut. 

He actually STOPPED CUTTING HER HAIR so he could stand in front of her and tell her all about their deals and gift cards and so forth. 

And I might add, he knew I was sitting there waiting. At 5:10pm, I left. He was still talking. 

I went to him because I saw one of his haircuts that was awesome, but life is way too short. I feel like I dodged a bullet today by walking out.

I now have a mullet. The pictures were *not* of a mullet.  If you like mullets, that's great. I had one in the 80s and once was enough. 

Also very aggressive stylist. It may have just been bad chemistry, but I don't think that earns me a crappy haircut.

I found 20/20 through Dr Rudavsky, who I also found here on Yelp, and who I also thought was wonderful and thorough and thoroughly professional. And, of course, he is a real doctor, not a sales person like the dork who examined my eyes at the fancy Pittsburgh place. 

As for the glasses -- couldn't be happier. Saving up to get a few more pair filled. Barry and Evan are indeed the best.  I am a bit of a collector of odd/vintage frames, so I didn't have the same concern as P.D. For me, the prices for lenses alone at 20/20 were so good that I had two other pairs of frames fitted with different prescriptions. 

And when one of them didn't work out for me -- through no fault of theirs, let me hasten to add -- they replaced the lenses and wouldn't let me pay. 

Please read that last sentence again. Happy happy."	review	E5O8wsWiGLqoOVBmG84wcw	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	4.2	{}	[]	0	[]	Della	11	user	{u'funny': 7, u'useful': 10, u'cool': 2}	2008-12

The place is in Rankin - a rough around the edges town in the Mon Valley between Swissvale and Braddock.  Don't be put off at first - the outside doesn't have much decoration to speak of and looks like the sort of place that you might think twice about it.  A TGI Fridays it isn't... And thank god for that.

The place is well-kept but a little dated -  no fripperies here.  But we're not here for the Decor - we're here for some dinner.  

The menu is basic with reasonable prices.  The meats and seafood are high quality and everything is made to order.  Their stuffed cabbage is regarded as the best in  Pittsburgh.  I love stuffed cabbage but I just made a batch a couple of weeks ago and I'm cabbaged out.  Their Ruebens are   also killer (our waitress raved about them).  My wife and I both settled on fish sandwiches.  These are true Pittsburgh fish Sammiches - fresh fried fish in crispy breading, crammed between enormous pillows of soft, yet chewy and crispy Mancini's Italian bread.  No adornments - just a boatload of hot crispy fish.  Emil's uses thick cod fillets piled high rather than a thin fillet that needs to be broken up to fit in the bun.  Truly a great sandwich.  My daughter had the BLT - looked good and on good bread and they weren't skimpy with the bacon.

The service was very pleasant and friendly and the crowd was a great group of folks.  We all had fun with 4 other tables when my wife pulled up a Trivial Pursuit game on her iPhone and pretty much everyone joined in and had a good laugh.

Overall, if you consider yourself a true Pittsburgher - you must visit this place.  It's one of the few places (Big Jim's in the Run is another) where the spirit of Pittsburgh is alive and hungry.

My regular mechanic was overbooked and there is snow coming on Monday.  Receptionist scheduled me in just fine and the quoted price was reasonable, so I said OK.  Upon arrival, store manager stated that they will not touch the car as it has aftermarket rims and lug nuts.  He did not state any restrictions about aftermarket parts as they could not guarantee the work.  I asked if this was the case for all rims and he became a little snotty.  I had heart surgery a while back and I can't do the jack and tire work as not to tear at my incision/breastplate, if this was not the case with my health, I'd certainly take care of it.  Aftermarket rims are common - should not be an issue.

Well once the order the food and enjoyed the best Reuben,  fish sandwich and stuffed peppers they were sold. The owner came over and thanked us for stopping. She is a real asset to the place.

Pros:
-engaging, diverse range of classes that get switched up often.

Going to spin and aerobics classes at EF can feel like being part of a community if you want it to

-functional equipment, various types of elliptical machines. Some things are old but some are new  

Cons:
-inconsistent with providing free sweat towels. Sometimes they are there sometimes they aren't. Not the hugest deal in the world

-NO SOAP IN THE WOMENS BATHROOM EVER. Seriously disgusting at a gym to know that no one is washing their hands with soap.

It was so great, that we actually went there twice during our 4-day vacation to catch the Steelers/Ravens game. 

They have daily sandwich specials. On Thursday night we went and had the special roast beef and cheese sand., and the .35 cent wings. Very, very tasty. I'm sorry, but this place kicks Primanti Bros. butt on the taste factor. They have about 8 different types of wings... reg., garlic, and I can't remember the rest - we got the regular, and I was wishing we would had ordered more.

Going back on a Friday night, we ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and a pepperoni n' mushroom.  Wow! That buffalo chicken pizza was awesome.

The other thing that stuck out for me was one of the customers. An older gentleman; he seemed to be a regular.

Seriously, this place is a melting pot... a United Nations of the thirsty, hungry, and hungover.  At first, I was afraid that at any moment some kind of fight was bound to break out.
Nope, everyone seemed to know everyone. I'm sure if I were able to visit more, I'd get to hug and air-kiss that cool bartender too!

We visited this place a couple of times during our visit, and at both times I felt both comfortable and nervous. Now, that's a real dive bar for ya. I kid, I kid.  
Although this place is indeed a dive, they serve food - burgers, pizza, cheese crisps (open-faced quesadilla, or Mexican pizza as I like to call it), deep fried mushrooms, fries, etc... Oldman had a chili-cheese burger, which was just the right size and messy, but not too messy - a two-napkin kind of burger. I had a deluxe cheese crisp, and I have to say, I don't know why I haven't made my quesadillas this way (topped with mushrooms, red peppers, and onion). They have a few pool tables, which were always in use, and Karaoke EVERY night. If you're in the area, I recommend checking this place out, especially if the NY bartender gal is working!"	review	ay9H1RpjbBkaiXGxfh7LaA	{u'funny': 4, u'useful': 4, u'cool': 3}	3.9	{u'profile': 10, u'cute': 29, u'funny': 109, u'plain': 130, u'writer': 89, u'list': 3, u'note': 79, u'photos': 42, u'hot': 133, u'more': 26, u'cool': 137}	[2007, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	49	[lxZSVeJz6KEBW1nlA3JKJg, aZMoXybovfI1mZtM2rwBow, P-lfV8cdAgEOZJkw2dJpsw, IOXtBBZ0MUQxIMGU6IAkyQ, NmxVejwT9x0l6ppVvG7P4g, QD0X0C-3LcLZ3icfDXYTpg, sA_CXaSoa0Jpk69wIFbhEg, 0Ke0iSAPYi8hUVxLocAlYQ, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, AaZdXn0I6F5bdIVwGpxdDA, nb2wZQ-DL7Bn72N_h9NMXw, zi0kxtr5gq0Flg7jYdIlMA, nbk3xRXuOVEgaNREigREKQ, ztpTP8QJIR3wqj-xCw6Mow, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, UcGdi7H_1sVqap4jvCVwqQ, kGgAARL2UmvCcTRfiscjug, 4fDuaApW_hRAtvcvwJXsrA, vrU_kYfmp0Mmh2S5-FY-sg, dbBOd6hZgFGdcbYCmGqFEQ, px9eAJ9BKLh3w4-RHRrMzA, oPG5VgtbV0DaDqYjBIgyXw, xgccxveHvOTt-3BwTHBXzg, -heP_e4m3mEiI75VozrGwA, -tezMd5id5AJvjc2MDjJmA, -ANkfLbDf8aiBQ7vywIL6w, w9-XB0IwcjAPCCa_tQy8Ag, 5uwVhPPaz5VHfboekqKsug, b5AvOyryK7RueqFi9Ui3cw, y8ZCNq8HSGDSx7Vm-NYEOw, NhXOaROBjlU-IuQrmWrQYQ, 8VlvzNAIdWGkPpK1lX5EzQ, 0Ypfll3kJiL5OrxBBat_Qw, ciIdgFaC_gSBHtkU2m7ETQ, N2B7jCkHlBieeVFdAKHkAw, diV5kCKxKrIyhzeNw6hbfw, pYsYs7eQ9SWqAaQS0xoRLA, 3x175sXzgadiYMlLErUMoA, VSRmWUjNkSSeV7PLBOuh1A, s74Gi6-mS5J5WnwGHKORfg, kl0zgp60RM09pySxA5NubA, uBp2Jmip2qXQ0iWHUDY9sQ, hduhIkC02HFWVlmDbPz4fA, IHUXwBK3pjsCxzuS_g9jCw, QfzkrqDCVLMDzQ2yo_3Iow, 89hz73bE6M4jzFID0fJ2pg, AFG-PK4yN3MbxSxj_wfxpg, _wY1dHBXKN4NjB5IsIk4eQ, NiZ2dvMiburRi6BZqxsVQw, kuP0AMnSGgkLfNSt0wOAgA, fr3HXiNw5JiIIspADCS5gA, wS4T9jTBd76e2nXh5bBlAg, JnEpFNLnj0TWOO9ZZ_Q4-w, nOA4lSY3D4xsUXJBT4H0pw, w1y7rcJAokqFyySEhd4r_A, AAX8oeoIq2UvMDLghGBclQ, PWXJpyVyAKtVehw4suOimg, _RxY3EOMnEOuV5zeAPvMwQ, 5jFb8g92NsJ9koLgqrAIYQ, wZougLAnwunlZ92tHbyZpg, xm34oeXnAFtWSi0katruUQ, oWKBHNGxTyp7B0Yr1dRxpw, UeX4WEs00L2IYanFS2JArw, wa5CqMa5bKcxQtB-QFA_lg, rxGMXiiZyxwnYUrWP1OJTQ, uTc1puvwUpFYryEHo4DNaA, JqUkqSzgWhEfMaNi3wznhQ, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, LH3e4CvIxgcKItEmdQFkNg, 9PlG0mQf33pLtFja69HF4g, 2ShjrKMCIcLRLCtafbqJmg, b-u85eePnSX5XtfEzIz7gg, AYGHNy8gPxl2Q-etTT3hZw, IEQlakFYC4Q7K3WXEajaSQ, aUSIhLDBj4yp_HOzgpRtww, 1PLiFGdZPPzlrIzWIKIz3A, P6cYaqErTTxz4dm6KuRxwg, oYTZ2PbYYd2MDbVYUoQpCw, eGdk9XWbnJ8FqFkgumI3gQ, DpZIZLRlaNwsNhhVWM9VXQ, ZkuPKOz3tN9iTUZrGzj3nQ, MA3OqgvlrRSrJBIepOEv2Q, 4jz83Df1emVCgifPOfuoFQ, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, a_l06mLnihJm3hwrpwfvVg, yMPjYA-BoFA-yIGYEXnXwg, 3S5x71_tte0ntKdfbcw2pA, cN_ZGu1ISXyGwW5qIxcRLA, m9fZy-oVP24dIgsOHStFUA, Tuhari9qXJdxfysLR2_Nrg, DPyotUsMsDcoRcVOSaQ_jQ, BRydUrmdK4pZsbUvZ8tBAw, DNN-pOqu6ldnt1-UP5cHaA, FBSXhhd4KFglcIomhDLDzQ, zhcXXB02UAPFoofdJ1wTsQ, ibrcU_Ww7_lzGW12qxLVng, 0Vq-ny4LHX5YBfSVADwDyw, Ss9EeL8rKVfPMzchhAD0fA, QVsmiSRb20Y0XpA5kxc8MQ, JoABS9Ti_eMrhv83K8QVWw, ...]	Kara	489	user	{u'funny': 1732, u'useful': 1754, u'cool': 1603}	2007-04

Although, at this time of day, the place was sparsely filled with definite regulars getting their drink and gamble on, the bartender was nice enough to us strangers. 

This really seems like the kind of place where the regulars go in the day, and everyone else is welcome at night. 
Where most people wouldn't know any of the selections on the juke box, therefore they give up, as to not piss off the regulars. 
Where you can get any drink from a bacon martini, to ass juice, to a graveyard trifecta... consisting of a can of Schlitz, ass juice and a slim jim for $5 (only from 2am to 10am)...so, we just missed breakfast."	review	ay9H1RpjbBkaiXGxfh7LaA	{u'funny': 6, u'useful': 4, u'cool': 7}	3.9	{u'profile': 10, u'cute': 29, u'funny': 109, u'plain': 130, u'writer': 89, u'list': 3, u'note': 79, u'photos': 42, u'hot': 133, u'more': 26, u'cool': 137}	[2007, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	49	[lxZSVeJz6KEBW1nlA3JKJg, aZMoXybovfI1mZtM2rwBow, P-lfV8cdAgEOZJkw2dJpsw, IOXtBBZ0MUQxIMGU6IAkyQ, NmxVejwT9x0l6ppVvG7P4g, QD0X0C-3LcLZ3icfDXYTpg, sA_CXaSoa0Jpk69wIFbhEg, 0Ke0iSAPYi8hUVxLocAlYQ, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, AaZdXn0I6F5bdIVwGpxdDA, nb2wZQ-DL7Bn72N_h9NMXw, zi0kxtr5gq0Flg7jYdIlMA, nbk3xRXuOVEgaNREigREKQ, ztpTP8QJIR3wqj-xCw6Mow, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, UcGdi7H_1sVqap4jvCVwqQ, kGgAARL2UmvCcTRfiscjug, 4fDuaApW_hRAtvcvwJXsrA, vrU_kYfmp0Mmh2S5-FY-sg, dbBOd6hZgFGdcbYCmGqFEQ, px9eAJ9BKLh3w4-RHRrMzA, oPG5VgtbV0DaDqYjBIgyXw, xgccxveHvOTt-3BwTHBXzg, -heP_e4m3mEiI75VozrGwA, -tezMd5id5AJvjc2MDjJmA, -ANkfLbDf8aiBQ7vywIL6w, w9-XB0IwcjAPCCa_tQy8Ag, 5uwVhPPaz5VHfboekqKsug, b5AvOyryK7RueqFi9Ui3cw, y8ZCNq8HSGDSx7Vm-NYEOw, NhXOaROBjlU-IuQrmWrQYQ, 8VlvzNAIdWGkPpK1lX5EzQ, 0Ypfll3kJiL5OrxBBat_Qw, ciIdgFaC_gSBHtkU2m7ETQ, N2B7jCkHlBieeVFdAKHkAw, diV5kCKxKrIyhzeNw6hbfw, pYsYs7eQ9SWqAaQS0xoRLA, 3x175sXzgadiYMlLErUMoA, VSRmWUjNkSSeV7PLBOuh1A, s74Gi6-mS5J5WnwGHKORfg, kl0zgp60RM09pySxA5NubA, uBp2Jmip2qXQ0iWHUDY9sQ, hduhIkC02HFWVlmDbPz4fA, IHUXwBK3pjsCxzuS_g9jCw, QfzkrqDCVLMDzQ2yo_3Iow, 89hz73bE6M4jzFID0fJ2pg, AFG-PK4yN3MbxSxj_wfxpg, _wY1dHBXKN4NjB5IsIk4eQ, NiZ2dvMiburRi6BZqxsVQw, kuP0AMnSGgkLfNSt0wOAgA, fr3HXiNw5JiIIspADCS5gA, wS4T9jTBd76e2nXh5bBlAg, JnEpFNLnj0TWOO9ZZ_Q4-w, nOA4lSY3D4xsUXJBT4H0pw, w1y7rcJAokqFyySEhd4r_A, AAX8oeoIq2UvMDLghGBclQ, PWXJpyVyAKtVehw4suOimg, _RxY3EOMnEOuV5zeAPvMwQ, 5jFb8g92NsJ9koLgqrAIYQ, wZougLAnwunlZ92tHbyZpg, xm34oeXnAFtWSi0katruUQ, oWKBHNGxTyp7B0Yr1dRxpw, UeX4WEs00L2IYanFS2JArw, wa5CqMa5bKcxQtB-QFA_lg, rxGMXiiZyxwnYUrWP1OJTQ, uTc1puvwUpFYryEHo4DNaA, JqUkqSzgWhEfMaNi3wznhQ, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, LH3e4CvIxgcKItEmdQFkNg, 9PlG0mQf33pLtFja69HF4g, 2ShjrKMCIcLRLCtafbqJmg, b-u85eePnSX5XtfEzIz7gg, AYGHNy8gPxl2Q-etTT3hZw, IEQlakFYC4Q7K3WXEajaSQ, aUSIhLDBj4yp_HOzgpRtww, 1PLiFGdZPPzlrIzWIKIz3A, P6cYaqErTTxz4dm6KuRxwg, oYTZ2PbYYd2MDbVYUoQpCw, eGdk9XWbnJ8FqFkgumI3gQ, DpZIZLRlaNwsNhhVWM9VXQ, ZkuPKOz3tN9iTUZrGzj3nQ, MA3OqgvlrRSrJBIepOEv2Q, 4jz83Df1emVCgifPOfuoFQ, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, a_l06mLnihJm3hwrpwfvVg, yMPjYA-BoFA-yIGYEXnXwg, 3S5x71_tte0ntKdfbcw2pA, cN_ZGu1ISXyGwW5qIxcRLA, m9fZy-oVP24dIgsOHStFUA, Tuhari9qXJdxfysLR2_Nrg, DPyotUsMsDcoRcVOSaQ_jQ, BRydUrmdK4pZsbUvZ8tBAw, DNN-pOqu6ldnt1-UP5cHaA, FBSXhhd4KFglcIomhDLDzQ, zhcXXB02UAPFoofdJ1wTsQ, ibrcU_Ww7_lzGW12qxLVng, 0Vq-ny4LHX5YBfSVADwDyw, Ss9EeL8rKVfPMzchhAD0fA, QVsmiSRb20Y0XpA5kxc8MQ, JoABS9Ti_eMrhv83K8QVWw, ...]	Kara	489	user	{u'funny': 1732, u'useful': 1754, u'cool': 1603}	2007-04

I went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one Friday night and it didn't disappoint. It is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - I'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place. 

The staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. The other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and I wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.

We ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. An overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (I know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, CANNED MUSHROOMS - the worst thing to come out of a can. Ever. I would rather eat canned Alpo than canned mushrooms. And if the mushrooms weren't canned, they were just the worst mushrooms I've ever consumed. The mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!

My advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, I'll never know."	review	JbWnXwjLaO1kncUkQOMajg	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 1}	3.95	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 6, u'plain': 8, u'writer': 1, u'note': 5, u'hot': 3, u'cool': 8, u'more': 1}	[]	2	[9a4W-3anHjCB28F7fAG0eg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, IRvRxAyXIB_ZZqt31j35eg, BpZ-Apl_2ZodZLgJ7Xupsg, WZgoM8UuzxjZf1AaWx3qZQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, NZdPZgewY0_I9UnnMzF1tg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, iqTmHFIaAefCGkhoiIimPg, 4FOk39NuFfMicEiH8r2Y3A, socNNfwbqsKoTvfSDA7uVw, GzMh3V8oVBoII38x1GpajQ, nHbHAqkKrrtt0jvqkwpuqg, 0EfU6vvU7buXmTc3LPsnNw, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, F87H5uoFJxp7oNd9LObaCA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, _vS9qNQvx8wVUOIkj4qfAg, 0Y6zpdtFlNVJki60HJVnEg, 9mbj_I-A8lpDJqdG-IWWLQ, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ]	Scott	123	user	{u'funny': 163, u'useful': 208, u'cool': 78}	2009-04

While in line I met folks from Rhode Island, Kentucky, and North Carolina, who all had come to McKees Rocks in their rental cars straight from the airport before even going to see their families - that is dedication and commitment to some seriously delicious pierogies.

Multiple fridges of cold beer, but only the cheap beer is cold.
Nice in person, but rude on the phone.
Parking lot, but none of the customers understand how to park.

Every good thing about this place is equaled with a bad thing about this place - hence it probably deserves 3 stars. I would really give it a 3.5 if available as this is currently my beer distributor of choice, but since its not possible I have to go with 4.

Why 4 you ask, when I just went through all that 3 star crap? Any place that offers beer samples provided by attractive women gets a half star boost for sure, and as long as I'm going there anyway it really makes for a more interesting trip.

After all, if you don't like free beer, you are probably a terrorist."	review	JbWnXwjLaO1kncUkQOMajg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 1}	3.95	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 6, u'plain': 8, u'writer': 1, u'note': 5, u'hot': 3, u'cool': 8, u'more': 1}	[]	2	[9a4W-3anHjCB28F7fAG0eg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, IRvRxAyXIB_ZZqt31j35eg, BpZ-Apl_2ZodZLgJ7Xupsg, WZgoM8UuzxjZf1AaWx3qZQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, NZdPZgewY0_I9UnnMzF1tg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, iqTmHFIaAefCGkhoiIimPg, 4FOk39NuFfMicEiH8r2Y3A, socNNfwbqsKoTvfSDA7uVw, GzMh3V8oVBoII38x1GpajQ, nHbHAqkKrrtt0jvqkwpuqg, 0EfU6vvU7buXmTc3LPsnNw, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, F87H5uoFJxp7oNd9LObaCA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, _vS9qNQvx8wVUOIkj4qfAg, 0Y6zpdtFlNVJki60HJVnEg, 9mbj_I-A8lpDJqdG-IWWLQ, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ]	Scott	123	user	{u'funny': 163, u'useful': 208, u'cool': 78}	2009-04

In addition to that lesson, the you will experience the following:
-Hotcakes so good you don't need to add syrup (mine were oatmeal raisin, like eating the amazing hybrid of a cookie and pancake)
-Potato pancakes so good that you'll wish you had multiple orders
-Slabs of ham. So good.

Add in the great service, ease to find parking, and decent prices and this place is truly a gem. Don't let the wait scare you unless you have a large group - people flow out of there pretty quickly, and for 2 people on a Sunday we only had to wait 10 minutes (and they gave us free samples while we waited).

I love that they have a specials page in the menu, so I make it a point to order something from it every time I visit. From chanterelle soup (with a nice story about the owner picking the mushrooms himself), to the Octoberfest pizza, to the bolognese lasagna, to the special pierogis - nothing on this menu has disappointed me in the least. I like that this part of the menu goes along with the seasons as well, it keeps the food fresh and keeps me on my toes when searching for dinner.

On a special note, the pizza here is definitely underrated. The crust is fantastic and you can actually see the pizza station tucked away in a corner of the church, so you know exactly what work goes into making such a delectable dough delight.

Along with the food, the beer is good as well. One of my pet peeves is a brewery that makes a watery stout (see: rock bottom), and thankfully the beer at the Church meets my expectations. Their seasonal/rotating beers are a great way to switch things up as well, and I have found myself contemplating the finer points in life while enjoying many of their brews.

If you hate good food and good beer, the setting itself is worth a visit. On my first visit, I couldn't believe that this place is actually just a church that was renovated to a brewpub. Stained glass windows - check, pipe organ - check, pews for seating - check. This place has it all.

So go for the food, beer, and atmosphere, get one of the specials and a new beer, and leave happy."	review	JbWnXwjLaO1kncUkQOMajg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.95	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 6, u'plain': 8, u'writer': 1, u'note': 5, u'hot': 3, u'cool': 8, u'more': 1}	[]	2	[9a4W-3anHjCB28F7fAG0eg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, IRvRxAyXIB_ZZqt31j35eg, BpZ-Apl_2ZodZLgJ7Xupsg, WZgoM8UuzxjZf1AaWx3qZQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, NZdPZgewY0_I9UnnMzF1tg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, iqTmHFIaAefCGkhoiIimPg, 4FOk39NuFfMicEiH8r2Y3A, socNNfwbqsKoTvfSDA7uVw, GzMh3V8oVBoII38x1GpajQ, nHbHAqkKrrtt0jvqkwpuqg, 0EfU6vvU7buXmTc3LPsnNw, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, F87H5uoFJxp7oNd9LObaCA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, _vS9qNQvx8wVUOIkj4qfAg, 0Y6zpdtFlNVJki60HJVnEg, 9mbj_I-A8lpDJqdG-IWWLQ, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ]	Scott	123	user	{u'funny': 163, u'useful': 208, u'cool': 78}	2009-04

For about 5 minutes at a time anyway, as that is all the longer this place takes to make a whole Original and there is no where to really eat unless you are daring enough to commandeer the pinball machine as your personal table.

This sandwich doesn't mess around. It is the epitome of a no-frills classic sandwich and should not be attempted by all the avid Subway lovers (you know who you are, you sad fools). The meat is piled on to crusty yet manageable bread. The toppings are fresh. The oil and herbs are plentiful. From the time you unwrap to the time the garbage gets taken away, the entire office smells like, well, sandwich. But not just any sandwich. This is a sandwich from yester-year, a simpler time, when sandwiches were made not for a $5 marketing campaign but rather because people need - nay, deserve - a damn good sandwich.

It's 1230AM Saturday. You've imbibed a fair amount after what amounts to a fairly miserable week. You want food, without prejudice.You think to yourself, ""I could really go for a waffle, blueberry muffin, biscuits, bacon, and cantaloupe. All on the same plate. All smothered in a layer of syrup, followed by a layer of melted cheese product, followed by as much country gravy as the plate can possibly hold. And I want to not only be hungover tomorrow, but also regret every delicious food mistake I've made in the past 8 hours. And when I'm all done, I want to eat a cookie that looks at me and subconsciously says 'don't worry friend, I'm not judging your eating habits, this smile is because you're awesome.'""

First, we had a group of 11, so the place reserved their side room for us which was pretty awesome. Next, the wait staff was super cool and patient with waiting for our mess of people to figure out what sushi/other foods they wanted. Then, the food came out and was absolutely delicious. After, the chefs even sent out some rolls they made special for us because they thought we would like them. Finally, the mochi/ice creams are included with the AYCE deal, so dessert was free (and fantastic).

The best dishes there? The Giant Clam piece was unbelievably delicious and really fun to tell people that you're eating (get it?!). Wet Dream was tantalizing. The Yama Special was perfectly prepared. The Seafood Salad had great pieces of fish in a fantastic sauce that I actually used instead of soy sauce for some of my tuna rolls. They offered Uni with the AYCE, and although I didn't like it I certainly appreciated that I was able to try it. The Edamame was low in salt for a change, which I can't praise enough. The best part is that no one had a piece of fish that was unpleasant, a feat not to be taken lightly at an AYCE sushi place. Also, the three people who decided not to get the sushi deal said that their dishes were also delicious and that they would go back again as well.

After the meal, the manager called us some cabs to get us back to the strip, which was really nice of her to do. The cabs didn't show after the 30 minute promised window, which if you know the politics involved with Vegas cabs really doesn't come as a surprise, so the manager called them again and complained. Then one cab finally came, which wasn't enough for all of us, so she called yet again to get us a ride back. Meanwhile, the restaurant is closing up shop behind us, but they asked us to wait inside their lobby area because it was cold outside and kept telling us we weren't in the way and asking if there was anything else we could do for them. This is what solidified their 5-star rating from me - I can't imagine anywhere else where the food is so good and the staff is so friendly and accommodating. Overall, this was the best eating experience on the trip and I say it was definitely worth the traveling hassle to eat there."	review	JbWnXwjLaO1kncUkQOMajg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 1}	3.95	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 6, u'plain': 8, u'writer': 1, u'note': 5, u'hot': 3, u'cool': 8, u'more': 1}	[]	2	[9a4W-3anHjCB28F7fAG0eg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, IRvRxAyXIB_ZZqt31j35eg, BpZ-Apl_2ZodZLgJ7Xupsg, WZgoM8UuzxjZf1AaWx3qZQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, NZdPZgewY0_I9UnnMzF1tg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, iqTmHFIaAefCGkhoiIimPg, 4FOk39NuFfMicEiH8r2Y3A, socNNfwbqsKoTvfSDA7uVw, GzMh3V8oVBoII38x1GpajQ, nHbHAqkKrrtt0jvqkwpuqg, 0EfU6vvU7buXmTc3LPsnNw, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, F87H5uoFJxp7oNd9LObaCA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, _vS9qNQvx8wVUOIkj4qfAg, 0Y6zpdtFlNVJki60HJVnEg, 9mbj_I-A8lpDJqdG-IWWLQ, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ]	Scott	123	user	{u'funny': 163, u'useful': 208, u'cool': 78}	2009-04

Imperial Palace offered all of these things, and for $200 a week to be smack dab in the middle of the strip I find myself liking this place.

That said, there are two issues that really hurt this place - uncomfortable beds and the worst elevators in which I've ever had the pleasure of being consistently froddaged on every excruciatingly long ride. I don't expect much when I'm not paying a ton of money, but I feel that there are basics that every hotel needs to offer.

The bartender that was working my tab made one hell of a Jim and diet, which made the $9 price tag a lot easier to swallow (seriously, it was strong - the strongest I've had since flirting with every single bartender in Santa Monica and getting drinks worthy of my efforts).

The greatest part of PURE is obviously the Pussycat Doll Lounge. God damn those girls know what they're doing, and if you don't believe me ask any of the other guys or girls that had their mouths open and drooling for the entire show. That's right - both guys AND girls were gawking together, the most definitive sign of a steamy hot show.

The kicker: $30. And its at the Bellagio, so you won't feel like you're a cheapass for going to a buffet instead of a pricey 5-star joint. Need more proof that its good?

What I do know is that when I saw my friend's tab for the two drinks he bought, I told him that I hope he also gets a squeezer or a small home to accompany the drinks or else he is getting royally screwed.

I consider myself a somewhat optimistic person, but I am at a complete loss for positive things to say about this place. I went here at brunch/lunch time to grab a quick bite before heading back to a conference, and I now wish I would've made the walk to McDonalds so I would've had some quality food and service - you heard right, McDs is quality compared to this junk.

My friends both ordered omelettes and I went with a chicken sandwich that involved avocados. The food wouldn't have even been all that bad if they wouldn't have... A) taken 25 minutes to deliver the goods, B) forgotten to tell us that they messed up our order and needed a few extra minutes, C) neglected to explain their mistake, D) placed my food under the warmer so that my bun became burnt and my lettuce an ever-appetizing wilty black, E) neglected to say one more word to us the entire meal - not even thank you.

Sometimes a restaurant delivers crappy food but the service makes up for the mistakes, and sometimes a black hole emerges in the kitchen and maliciously sucks in every hint of good service and humanity of the entire staff. I probably should have expected all of this knowing that the restaurant the bastard child of Cheesecake Factory, but that damned blind optimism got the best of me. Spend the extra cash and go somewhere else, or go to the food court and get a respectable panini, or just don't eat and get a martini instead - any option is a step in the right direction as long as it is a step away from Grand Lux.

Also, a side note - there was something like 200 items to order from on this menu, meaning that I can rest assured that the entrees have been frozen longer than Ted Williams, yum yum."	review	JbWnXwjLaO1kncUkQOMajg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.95	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 6, u'plain': 8, u'writer': 1, u'note': 5, u'hot': 3, u'cool': 8, u'more': 1}	[]	2	[9a4W-3anHjCB28F7fAG0eg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, IRvRxAyXIB_ZZqt31j35eg, BpZ-Apl_2ZodZLgJ7Xupsg, WZgoM8UuzxjZf1AaWx3qZQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, NZdPZgewY0_I9UnnMzF1tg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, iqTmHFIaAefCGkhoiIimPg, 4FOk39NuFfMicEiH8r2Y3A, socNNfwbqsKoTvfSDA7uVw, GzMh3V8oVBoII38x1GpajQ, nHbHAqkKrrtt0jvqkwpuqg, 0EfU6vvU7buXmTc3LPsnNw, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, F87H5uoFJxp7oNd9LObaCA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, _vS9qNQvx8wVUOIkj4qfAg, 0Y6zpdtFlNVJki60HJVnEg, 9mbj_I-A8lpDJqdG-IWWLQ, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ]	Scott	123	user	{u'funny': 163, u'useful': 208, u'cool': 78}	2009-04

The first time I went in there, I was 19 years old on summer break from college and working at the ice cream factory up the hill.  All of the union guys from the ice cream factory went in there after work, and I immediately found out why.  MANY, MANY years later, I stopped in there with some fond memories, and once again felt welcomed and valued as a customer, even though they didn't know who I was.  THE SANDWICHES are done Pittsburgh-style, sort of like Primanti's, and they are as perfect today as they were back in ancient times when I first started visiting the place.  Alexion's is a clean and peaceful little place in the Rook Station part of Green Tree, the oldest part of the town.  I recall that some of the sandwiches I got there were ordered at a pretty late hour.

I've been stopping at Cain's since I can't remember when, and maybe their tap selection has something to do with that.  I have never failed to find something interesting and crafty on tap at Cain's.

My favorite night to stop at Cain's is Wednesday.  I try to get there early, because later in the evening, the place is usually packed out, even though there is a lot of seating.  On Wednesdays, Cain's has a special on their excellent chicken wings.  They are done the right way, and among my top favorites in the South Hills.

You can't go wrong at Cain's during happy hour.  Half price on all appetizers and a dollar off all drinks from 5 to 7.  But my favorite plan of attack at Cain's is to arrive around 4:45 and order the ""half sandwich and a soup"" deal they call ""express lunch.""  It is served until 5:00, and you can't beat a half sandwich and two sides for $5.99.  By the time my food arrives, it's happy hour and the beers are a buck off, but you have to be seated in the bar area, supposedly.  My favorite sandwich to get with this deal is the Reuben, served with some volcano chili and slaw, but I've had other interesting sandwiches there as well.  The chili has got some NICE punch to it, and I am definitely a fan.

I remember way back when this place wasn't so pretty, but they have done a nice job with updating the place and you won't be embarrassed to bring a date to this place.  But don't be surprised if you end up having to stand for quite a while before you can get a seat on a Wednesday night.  Chivalry is not dead in Dormont, which is one of my favorite parts of the South Hills, and I have seen young men give up their seats in favor of older ladies at Cain's.

I'm sure that many of the foodie-types who frequent Yelp are going to dismiss this place, but having heard so much about it from my local pizza-loving friends about the pie at Fiori's, I finally decided to stop and order a couple of pizzas to go while I was in the neighborhood.  The sauce definitely isn't for everyone - it's a departure from the typical corporate pizza crap that everyone has gotten used to.  But the sauce is INTERESTING, and the crust is PERFECT.  A little too much flour used when it was flown, but I'm guessing that's because the place was doing such a high volume of business.  The pepperoni reminds me of the old Mineo's pizza, small slices that curl up and produce little grease pools.  WOW, now that's the pepperoni I love, and definitely not the pepperoni you'll find at Papa John's, or Vocelli's, or Domino's, or Little Caesar's, or Pizza Hut.  This is the PIZZA of your youth - the pizza you remember your dad bringing home, complete with the relic-style pizza box.  It's not in my neighborhood, and I'm lucky enough to live close to Luciano's, but if I'm hungry and in the vicinity of Fiore's any time soon, I won't hesitate to grab a couple more pies - maybe one for dinner and one for breakfast!	review	4-3IU5uUH90m21TWbZhhnA	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.83	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 1, u'plain': 1, u'writer': 1, u'photos': 1, u'more': 2, u'cool': 5}	[]	2	[WEppeczBa630qanow0uqig, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, gSLy4fdXb2smyGGJ7TAxNQ, 8IjVESbd_bQcPN_AIAY5hw, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ]	Bernard	56	user	{u'funny': 27, u'useful': 97, u'cool': 22}	2011-08

I walked into The Ugly Dog Saloon because I saw it and liked the name. The parking lot was crowded, so I figured, ""popular place."" All of the tables were filled, and I managed to find one empty seat at the bar. They had a nice selection of beers on their taps, so I ordered one of my favorite IPAs and some buffalo wings and fries from a very pretty lady at the bar. I was shocked at how fast they came out of the kitchen. I figured I'd be waiting a long time for my food because of how crowded the place was, but in under five minutes I had a plate full of hot and crispy wings, and some exceptionally crispy fries. They were those batter coated fries, and I ate every last one of them. I tried another microbrew that I hadn't ever had before and asked for my check from a very polite, and very tall, young man working behind the bar. I was stunned at how low my bill was, but I had come during one of their wing night specials. I left an extra large tip, and decided that this was the kind of place that I'd like to come back to. The next time I visited, it was with a friend, and it was ""a hockey night in Pittsburgh."" The place was once again packed, and we had to stand for a little while before somebody left and we got a seat. Once again, the bartenders took care of us right away, and the food came out super quick, and the wings were delicious. I've only been to this place three times, and every time I've had a good experience. It can be a little on the loud side in there, but that's because there are lots of people in the room, and it's a large room.

255	63M2e_wSmQ8GbLDUau5K6Q	2014-01-23	Kd04Ohev8EjCnlVn4VqZSQ	5	"First of all, I don't go to Italian restaurants.  My Italian grandmother lived to be 102 years old, and she taught me everything I know about cooking Italian food, so I am almost ALWAYS disappointed when I end up ordering from somebody's menu.  No brag, just fact... I am a great Italian cook, even though I don't look like one...

So, it was with some trepidation that I accepted an invitation from my dining partner to check out one of her favorite places to go with the bigshots from work.  I knew I'd be disappointed.  Ooops... Guess what happened?  Yes, I loved it.  

I loved it so much that I came back to explore the menu further.  And then I came back AGAIN to try what I had almost ordered the second time!  And NOW?  Well, NOW I'm actually signed up for a very pricey cooking class in the downstairs kitchen studio at La Tavola, hosted by a remarkable matron of the kitchen, Carmella.  Yes, I'm pretty serious about Italian cooking, and after three wonderful meals enjoyed by me, my partner, and some friends, I decided that the opportunity to learn from this lady was too good to pass up.  I can hardly wait - and of course, I selected a date when she is teaching a veal dish.  In fact, FIVE of us are attending Carmella's cooking class, and one of us has signed up for a second class already.  

I plan to bring a nice primitivo, and one of my friends is bringing a couple of bottles of fine chianti, because La Tavola is BYOB.  I think they actually get around liquor law somewhat with their dessert menu, which features some high powered rum cake and limoncello sorbet.  From beginning to end, I have enjoyed every bite of everything I have sampled at this place since being turned on to it.  And we SHARE, so every time I've been there, I and my friends have ordered different dishes so we could have a broader sampling of the menu.

The menu is very interesting.  It's a composite of tried-and-tested simplicity and creative genius for the more adventurous.  The dishes are very accurately described, and there is a lot to choose from, so bring your reading glasses and be prepared to waffle back and forth on your selection.

The atmosphere of the place is SO VERY throwback.  It feels like New York City in the 60s or early 70s.  Honestly, if you were just driving around the neighborhood looking for a less expensive Mount Washington restaurant that DIDN'T have a view, you would probably drive right by this place.  But, in a fond memories of my Italian grandmother kind of way, it's VERY charming.  There is plenty of seating, and if you don't come early, you ARE going to wait.  Good things are worth waiting for, but my advice is to COME EARLY before they get slammed.  By the way, there's a REASON they get slammed, and it's NOT the decor or the view.

I was very surprised to see any negative reviews of this place, and I have a few tips for you:
1. Don't trust a review of Italian food by someone who doesn't know how to spell ""lasagna.""  The lasagna at La Tavola is excellent, but some people are used to Stouffer's, and their opinions don't count.
2. Don't trust reviews from impatient reviewers who were unhappy with their experience because they had to wait too long for the food.  There's a REASON you had to wait too long.  People love this place, and they come back often, and sometimes really good food takes time to prepare, unlike the microwave crap that you are accustomed to.  By the way, REAL Italian families can spend HOURS at the dinner table when they gather.
3. Don't trust reviewers who complain about getting ""too much food"" at an Italian restaurant.  Skinny jeans people have no place at a real Italian table, unless they don't mind finishing their meal over the course of several days, which apparently SOME people have a problem with.
4. Don't trust reviews by people who claim to be Italians that expect EVERY dish to be over-garliced, over-spiced, and over-priced.  If they don't understand the SUBTLETIES of real Italian cooking, then they probably don't cook for themselves and have been duped by the HIPSTER purveyors of pseudo-Italian bastardizations.  If you want AUTHENTIC, then don't complain when AUTHENTIC doesn't tickle your burned out palate.
5. Don't trust reviews of Italian food that are written by people who live in places like Utah, and who complain about the food being ""blah"" or claim that they could have made it cheaper themselves at home.  Really?  Subtlety in Italian cooking is authentic.  Simplicity in Italian cooking is authentic.

Rant concluded.  Now, if you want me to repeat this in my NEW YORK ITALIAN kind of way, I'm going to require the use of my hands and a few expletives.

I arrived around 3:40PM this particular day and they closed at 5PM. They got me right in- they called LeasePlan and had my truck done within 30 minutes and that was with an air filter change.

You may think this is nothing and this is all normal, but you need to understand with a Fleet truck, a lot of places say they do ""fleet vehicles"" then you bring it in and they have no clue and they take 4 hours for an oil change. So I really appreciated the fact the guys were quick and efficient. 

They vaccum the vehicle and clean all your windows. They are also VERY friendly, they all asked how I was and if my day was going ok. Very good personalities, which is always a plus for customer service.

I felt bad for our waiter-he didn't understand the gluten free aspect and messed up the order at first and the final bill. 

He apologized but it was more of me telling him, no the menu says this so it's this price etc etc. He came back and said ""you were right"" well duh! I usually am...jokes people!

The gluten free menu here is VERY limited, if you have been to the Roy's in baltimore you will be disappointed in this one. I think there were 5 apps you could pick from, 3-4 main courses and 2 desserts. They did not have a seperate GF drink menu. 

We did the prix fixe menu. We both got the california rolls (YAY they are made with real crab instead of the wheat filled imitation). Our waiter brought us the wheat filled soy sauce, luckily he had another waiter who seemed a little more aware of gluten allergy who brought the correct soy sauce out. (Tamari)

Jason for the braised short rib-very tastey. I got the lemongrass chicken with jasimine rice and curry sauce-I love thai flavors. The chicken was lacking flavor but the rice and sauce were melt in your mouth. 

We then both ordered the GF chocolate souffle. not disappointed there either. 

There are 2 Roy's in vegas, we did not have the chance to go to the other one. 

Service-disappointing for Roy's and the knowledge of GF was lacking. Food was still flavorful and melt in your mouth.

There was a nice selection of hot and ready pierogis to choose from which was nice and there were a few available behind the counter ""cold"".  Most of the specialty type pierogies require special orders (potato and meat etc.)

I had a meatball sandwich for $5.50 and it was tasty. It was the size of a half meatball hoagie.   The woman that waited on me said that the meatballs were homemade.    Of course I had to get some delicious Pierogies.. ""Potato and Cheese (submerged in butter and onions).

The new location is now in Kennedy Township... located conveniently in the Kenmar Plaza - next to Subway.   The Robinson location is now closed.  I am thrilled about the move its closer to my home.   Hot Sausage, Sweet Sausage, Meatballs etc.   There are frozen food items available too - pasta, sauce, meatballs etc. There is also a shelf in the store stocked with sausage buns, sauce and other items.  I often stop after work to grab dinner because they are open until 6:00.    Specials:  Pazzo Monday: any sandwich or  1/2 sausage roll with a soft drink is $5.99.  Tuesday/Thursday: Mac and Cheese with ground hot sausage $2.75 per serving.   Friday: Sherrys Pasta e'Fagoli $3.75 per serving Wednesday/Saturday: (MY FAVORITE SPECIAL):  Homemade Lasagna - made with homemade sauce, Tallutos lasagna pasta, grande and lamagna cheese and ricci ground hot sausage $4.25 per serving.  I must tell you that the lasagna is my favorite menu item at Ricci and anytime I get it .. when I eat it.. I get into a ""zone"". And I don't ever share.. yes it's THAT good.

I love to make my own spaghetti sauce using Ricci Italian Sausage.  I have tried using other types of sausages - like giant eagle brand but you can always tell when its ""Ricci's Sausage"" because it's a good batch of sauce and everyone raves about it.

We walked into the door and there was a woman standing near the door and she shot us a look of surprise (or frustration) and asked if we had a reservation? Well that wasn't the greeting I was expecting and was surprised at this question since the place was empty but within a half hour I totally understood why.

This small but quaint restaurant filled up very fast.  This establishment is just lovely and was clean and was decorated for the holiday season.  It was cozy.   The menu was small but had something for everyone and the prices weren't too bad but It might be a little pricey if you are on a budget but it's worth it trust me.   

The service was excellent.. we received beverages and bread within a moments time.  Our bread basket never remained empty either. 
We ordered the ""beans and greens"" as an appetizer and it was delicious. My Italian Mother makes this dish all the time and it was ""almost"" as good as hers - which is saying a lot.  
  
I had penne pasta with sausage, roasted red peppers, olives and artichokes.   It was very tasty but was a bit salty for my taste (think it was the olives) but still delicious.  My friend ordered the Walleye and was very pleased.  The tossed salad that came with my entree was just the right size and everything was fresh.
Fresh greens and was accompanied by carrots, red onions, feta, cherry tomatoes and olives.   By the time we were ready to leave there wasn't an empty table in the place.  
The restaurant is located on the corner at a very convenient location in North side with parking available on the street right outside the restaurant. Getting back on 279 was a snitch. 

The restroom doors were so festive and unique that I couldn't resist taking a picture !!   The restrooms were also clean too.

I love restaurants that aren't ""chains"" and have their own flair .. and this establishment has that! 

I am very happy we decided to have dinner at Legends of the North Shore and will no doubt be visiting again ...

I was surprised at the very little meat on my hoagie especially by the price $6.75.  I might just order double meat next time.   Another surprise was that there is a burger called ""#7 Roethlis Burger"" which I love the idea although I have never had .. but ketchup brand offered is not ""Heinz"" brand.   I love the menu .. so many different types of sandwiches, salads etc. there is something for everyone.   

These were just observances.. my steak hoagie was good and satisfied with the great customer service.  

I just visited recently during lunch time at Noon.  As soon as I got there I regretted it but soon realized ""it was all good"".  The staff was so cool and calm and on the ball.. it was a zoo and the line was out the door."	review	Sjb5e5-gKoLXueFDMc2R8Q	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.84	{u'note': 2, u'plain': 6, u'hot': 6, u'writer': 1, u'cool': 2}	[2015]	3	[9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, NmJ0tN6f61sS7mwg7HM0VQ, CXU-w_3hRMYooGopYE8H1A, vDCWul6e4NaKU_0YvoxNog, r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ, J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA, bZpBAaxC0L9LzrQPUJF7ew, GeK2XiAoWB11fV_xOk3vpA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, 8KnxWsDYYKg07Qn4f7tEAg, fgW8QChlsdVVd_sSjAiE8w, 9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ, xpvpJB3DArM9zhb10Z1rvg, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, qydiiRiigZ6pHunHjXTuFQ, JaCp2YGR22uDOCFE9AcauQ, L_1ldS4LQxCt7cVN1tfWAQ, WGXfllGHz1rnXbVLB8pTkg, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	Nena	105	user	{u'funny': 9, u'useful': 94, u'cool': 64}	2012-11

The burger was pretty big - not bad for the price $4.95.   French fries are an additional $2.50.
 
The fries were good - cooked just right and with a side of gravy they were even better!  Perfect dipping size.

I remember when I was a little girl spending the holidays at my grandparent's house..my cousins would tear apart the bread (instead of slicing) and dip into butter and garlic and then bake.   I still make that type of garlic bread from time to time and oh that taste just brings me back to my childhood.    So dam good.

My current favorite ...a few slices of twist to accompany ""sponge"" stew (recipe passed from my Italian aunts).   

I stop at the bakery probably once or twice a week for bambini pizza shells, breadcrumbs, twist or pepperoni roll.   The bambini's are the perfect size for a personal pizza.  They bake just right on a medium temp in the toaster oven and are just delicious.   I like to draw some lines with a fork and add a little olive oil and seasonings.  The bakery also sells breadcrumbs (un-seasoned) which are handy to have.  I buy the breadcrumbs and keep them in the fridge/freezer and they are fantastic to cook with. I enhance with Italian seasonings right before breading.  The pepperoni rolls are very popular .. and go very fast.  I like to stock up on the hoagie rolls and cut into pieces and freeze.   It's so delightfully convenient that Giant Eagle and Ricci Sausage - amount other establishments carry the bread too.Sure I pick up from time to time .. but the extra few minutes it would take to drive to the bakery is worth it.   

I couldn't imagine living in Pittsburgh ""without"" Mancinis bread. It is really the best bread in the world."	review	Sjb5e5-gKoLXueFDMc2R8Q	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.84	{u'note': 2, u'plain': 6, u'hot': 6, u'writer': 1, u'cool': 2}	[2015]	3	[9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, NmJ0tN6f61sS7mwg7HM0VQ, CXU-w_3hRMYooGopYE8H1A, vDCWul6e4NaKU_0YvoxNog, r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ, J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA, bZpBAaxC0L9LzrQPUJF7ew, GeK2XiAoWB11fV_xOk3vpA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, 8KnxWsDYYKg07Qn4f7tEAg, fgW8QChlsdVVd_sSjAiE8w, 9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ, xpvpJB3DArM9zhb10Z1rvg, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, qydiiRiigZ6pHunHjXTuFQ, JaCp2YGR22uDOCFE9AcauQ, L_1ldS4LQxCt7cVN1tfWAQ, WGXfllGHz1rnXbVLB8pTkg, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	Nena	105	user	{u'funny': 9, u'useful': 94, u'cool': 64}	2012-11

I feel very fortunate to live in Pittsburgh and have access to this great museum.
$20.00 admission may seem a bit high but if you think about it - it's worth it to support the arts.

You can visit the first floor and gift shop for free and you are permitted to take photographs on the first floor too. 

There is so much to see at this 7 floor museum.  You could spend an entire day and still not experience everything this museum has to offer.  The store in the museum has so many little unique items that you wouldn't find anywhere else.. from books to cool iphone covers for your phone ..  a lot of interesting little treasures...
 
The Warhol Café located on the ground level has coffee, salads .. and comfortable tables and chairs to relax.  

There is small parking lot for the museum ($7.00) but it fills up fast.  Theres also parking available on the street.

I am a huge fan of buffalo wings and they are a dime a dozen here in the burg.   Spicy Parm is no doubt - unforgettable... the best. Spicy and cheesy - it's the perfect blend.  
I have tried other menu items in the past but right now hooked on the parm wings.  My last visit to Fatheads I ordered the twenty count wings - slightly crispy (they are always done exactly how requested) and took half home and I had for breakfast the next day!! I couldn't wait !  Yes I love them that much.  
Menu is exploding with plenty of options for just about anyone.
I will no doubt be updating this review often.

Tonight a friend and I dined at your location. We were seated in the bar area by the sidewalk, which is what we requested because of the great weather and the happy hour specials. Our server took our order of a gingerale, fried zucchini appetizer, side salad, wedding soup , eggplant rolotini and chicken piccata ( correct spelling).

We thoroughly enjoyed the bread & wedding soup.
The side salad was rather bland and unexciting, lacking flavor & texture. The Spring salad consisted of leaf lettuce, a single slice of tomato and one black olive. I would have expected some additions such as onions, peppers, cheese, cucumbers, croutons, carrots and the like.
 
  We enjoyed the fresh air while waiting for our appetizer, but were growing concerned that it would arrive too close to the meal, so we asked the server ( bartender ) about the appetizer and he told us that he had forgot to ""put it in"". He offered to put it in at this point, but advised us that our meals would be out soon. We decided to just wait for our meals and forgo the appetizer which were looking forward to. 
 
  The main dishes were acceptable, not outstanding. The eggplant was very tasty and well prepared.  The Chicken Piccata was flavorful, but not as expected.
The chicken seemed to have been steamed or baked. It had no signs of being coated and sautéed  to a rich golden brown. The chicken was just pale white.
The sauce was a simple lemon flavor, it lacked any depth that would have resulted from the browning of the chicken. I tasted no garlic or shallots. The sauce lacked that famous tang usually supplied by capers, which were absent.  No pasta was served with the chicken. The side of vegetables were well cooked, buy again lacked any real flavor. The would have benefited from a roasting which would have produced a rich savory taste produced by extraction of the natural sugars.

  Once our meals were finished  our plates were taken and we waited another 20 minutes for the check. The server seemed more concerned with what was on television rather than his customers. The total was $43 and change.
I would have expected the salad and soup would have been removed from the bill for the error of not putting in our appetizer order, but no such offer was made and 
I saw no manager come around and check on the customers, as is customary.
I am hesitant to go back to this restaurant or  recommend it to anyone after tonights dining experience.  I hope this feedback will be beneficial to your business."	review	GcBAIs4pzeK6OzHpawgZlg	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	2.8	{u'note': 1, u'plain': 1, u'cool': 1}	[]	0	[nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ]	Derek	54	user	{u'funny': 32, u'useful': 75, u'cool': 9}	2010-09

   I mentioned to an employee that there was a few slices of cheese on the floor behind the counter, I received no response.
 I completed my Whopper Jr. and then went up to the counter to order a 4 piece Chicken Nugget. I paid and told the server that I wanted Sweet and Sour with those, he said ""we don't have sweet and sour"". I then requested Barbeque. He said they had no sauces..only Ketchup.   I asked why he didn't tell me that when I ordered and he said I didn't ask.  I requested a refund and was issued one. I also noticed that the cheese slices on the floor were still there.

We ordered within 5 minutes of sitting down, there couldn't have been more than 20 people in the place, counting the people on the patio.  Took them almost 40 minutes to serve 3 sandwiches and a salad. I tried the fish sandwich, came out fried extra crispy on the ends, if there is such a thing as fish jerky a third of the sandwich would have qualified, it was just ok. I've had better at almost any church that fries fish during Lent. 

All 3 of my dinner companions left partial sandwiches  or salad uneaten. Bread french fries and onion rings were good though. Iced tea was good, though I've never seen a place dispense sweet n low like they were giving away their last rock of crack. Asked for sugar but never saw any, they don't carry any other artificial sweeteners besides the pink stuff.

I may give the place another try in the future for a Reuben or hamburger, assuming today was some aberration possibly due to a cook having a family emergency or something like that. Waitress was pretty good, held up under my multiple requests to find out if they caught my fish yet, hardly ever rolled her eyes :)"	review	udy8pMNA09YDs98e51wXZQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.0	{}	[]	0	[]	Dave	4	user	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 1}	2013-09

I would not call this Caribbean though I would call this modern Caribbean fusion the staff is attentive and the drinks will definitely get you turned up. I would give this place 5 stars but I did have one issue the Caribbean is relaxing and comfortable but this place missed that completely. It felt a little stuffy I really never relaxed while there. Another problem I had was the rum selection was extensive but like most places in the city they completely miss one of the best destinations in the Caribbean. The Dominican Republic. Now I have to admit because my wife is Dominican and i have been exposed to that culture the most I tend to look for those flavors and I never see it represented in Pittsburgh. But that's more of a issue with the city's Latin population not having representation then just this place.

The biggest negative for me was how long it took to get our food.  I was there on my lunch break and it was not at all crowded.  By the time our food came , my lunch hour was just about over and we had to inhale the food so that I could get back to work.

The drinks were priced far below that of the neighboring competition. (Second +)

I'm a vegetarian, so most of the menu was off limits for me, but since it was my first visit here i had to try something. Ended up ordering the onion rings and fries - Best i've ever had. (third +)

The service was amazing. Mary, the kitchen manager, was beyond wonderful. Kept the food being delivered to the tables, kept the drinks filled, and smiled about it the whole time. The other servers (apologize for not knowing their names) were awesome as well. They treated everyone in our group and others around us wonderfully. (fourth +)

Mary has been there for 35 of the restaurant's 144 years, and loves every moment of it. i will definitely be going back to this place for the fun atmosphere."	review	trYPAmnPz6ChpIgx0jGbyg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.17	{u'note': 1, u'plain': 1, u'hot': 2, u'cool': 3}	[2015]	2	[9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, -SDZuDIIJgH53vso0hKaxQ, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, oysHaJHbxkWNbUQ40BUd3w]	Shawna	35	user	{u'funny': 16, u'useful': 25, u'cool': 7}	2012-07

I've been brushed on the leg and knee multiple times by cut-throat drivers in that parking lot.  I believe they would park INSIDE the store if they could).
I don't complain about the prices, because the food, and health benefits, are worth it in the long-term.  Not so long ago, I was forking out hundreds of dollars a month in prescription medications because my diet was HORRIBLE.  Since making the decision over two years ago to be more active and eat solely organic and Non-GMO, I'm off all of my medications, and the price of organic food is NOTHING compared to medications and prescriptions.  I'm actually saving money.  And No, I don't even make $20K a year - so it's all about choices.  I'm not ""rich"" at all, like most people assume, since I regularly shop there.  In fact, I'm usually dead broke.  But to me, eating whole and healthy and protecting my body is not a luxury, it's a necessity.
I also like that there is no pharmacy in Whole Foods.  That should say something.
My love for Whole Foods resides in the Organic Salad Bar, and Prepared Foods section.  Their salad bar is so fresh and so delicious, that eating salads anywhere else becomes TASTELESS.  Organic makes all the difference.
My favorite Prepared Foods is their Vegan General Tso's ""chicken"".  Little popcorn nuggets of Seitan, drenched in the best General Tso's sauce I've ever tasted, with steamed broccoli.  Molly's Sesame Noodles on the salad bar is our favorite side dish to this prepared foods treat.  I swear we eat it at least once a week.
We also love their Bulk Section where we can get bulk quinoa, granola, lentils, and all kinds of things for a really decent price.  
The secret to shopping at Whole Foods?   BUY WHAT YOU NEED TO EAT THAT DAY.  It's not smart to bulk shop organic produce, because it goes bad faster.  Buy what you KNOW you're going to eat.  You won't see 10/$10 deals, because the food isn't crap, and you're not supposed to stockpile fresh foods.  You're supposed to eat it when it's fresh.  And buy your dry stock at Trader Joe's or the East End Food Co-Op.
I love Whole Foods.

337	l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg	2011-07-27	7akANQ5TN0Hb0UDRbEBV8Q	5	"This is the kind of restaurant that I deeply appreciate.  Family-owned.  Off the main roads.  Charming interior.  Unique staff.  WONDERFUL FOOD.  (We called this our ""less-expensive Casbah"" when we left).

Like everywhere we end up going, we go because a Yelp review we have read, that inspired us to give it a try.  We new it was BYOB, but we weren't in the mood for drinking, so we walked on over.  It was our own fault that we got there, at 5:00pm, on the dot - and they were not quite ready to be opened, as they were finishing setting up the tables.  My boyfriend and I took a quick walk around Ellsworth.  It's a family-owned business where they turned their front garage into the most charming, artsy-like, romantic restaurant.  We'll cut them some slack!

When we got back, they were ready for us; and we chose to snag a table outside (they thought we were nuts).  However, in one of the reviews, we read that they had no A/C, which was a big selling point for us (I absolutely loathe going into a freezing cold, A/C'd out restaurant, and being forced to bring a hoodie with me, when it's 90+ outside.  And we do kind of like hot, humid, and muggy); but, I guess they have upgraded because the A/C was BLASTING on the inside of the restaurant.

We started off with the Gazpacho.  This was a perfect summer starter because it was cool, extremely flavorful, and a natural air conditioner to the body.  It had lumps of shrimp and crab meat at the bottom, which made us feel like we were eating somewhere on Duval St. in Key West.  I normally don't like cilantro, but the cilantro was so subtle and completely rounded out the flavor.  When our waitress brought out the freshly baked loaf of corn bread, we sopped up the rest of it.  It is true, the wait staff genuinely appreciates your compliments and feels honored every time you say you enjoyed something.

I ordered the Wild Mushroom Ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the Lamb Burger.  When our dishes came out, they were the most beautiful dishes I had ever seen - full of color, wonderful portion sizing, and aromas just attacking the olfactory with sensational goodness.  My Ravs were topped with this grape tomato paquillo sauce, which tasted like it had hints of red pepper also.  It was FANTASTIC.  Plus, there were whole mushrooms, okra, carrots, and cauliflower on top of the dish as well.  I don't know what kind of separate seasonings were on the veggies, but they were to-die-for also.  I can't exactly remember how many Ravs were in my bowl, but every time I thought I was finished, there was another ravioli to be found, and then another.  For the price - I think there were a total of 10 fully-stuffed, hand-made mushroom ravs.  Incredible.

My boyfriend's Lamb Burger came with a cranberry and raisin jam (but ""jam"" seems to cliché of a word for this topping), and a salad that had slices of apples in it.  Now I'm usually not one to eat sweeter tasting foods; however, the complementing of sweet and savory in this dish blew my mind.  I'm also not a big fruit eater (unless it's blended in a smoothie), but I totally got past all that because the flavors and the textures all are playing nicely with one another.

We opted out of dessert because we were so stuffed.  But our bill for an appetizer and two filling, insanely delicious entrees came to $40.  DING DING DING DING DING!  WE HAVE FOUND A WINNER!  

After dinner the owner came over to our table and we were introduced.  What a wonderful, sweet, and genuine older guy.  We will definitely be back before the menu changes again; and next time, we're going for entrees and dessert!!

338	ih6d7hBWss05xXWUznuFaw	2011-09-06	2jcE0Ce69sDPGDhxjEaSIw	2	"So...I was sold on MCN Salon about a year ago, and found it through Yelp reviews.  I really was sold at one point.  It's clean.  It's up-scale.  It's hip.  It's pretty.
But after my last haircut, I'm going to suck it up, and make the 45 minute drive back to my old stylist in Peters Township.
Basically - I just feel like they're trying to up-sell you the entire time on products and more services.  For example, if I wanted my eyebrows colored, I probably would have added that to my appointment.
Their stylists are GREAT, don't get me wrong, but I just don't feel like I'm being pampered or focused on when I'm there.  The last time, my stylist was working on 3 different people while I was getting a cut and color.  Therefore, that left junior stylists to wash and dry my hair.  The time before that, the stylist was working on 2 different people.  I have no problem with that - I just don't know who to tip at the end because I feel like my main stylist, actually did very little in the long run.  
Plus - I told my stylist on our very first visit - ""I don't want to think about my hair.  YOU are the STYLIST!  YOU are the DESIGNER!  Every time I come in here, I will want a different hair cut, but I want YOU to do it.  You will NEVER hear me say, 'just trim it up and do like we did last time'.  So please, I trust you to just make me look HOT.""
Well - the whole past year that I have gone there, I have sadly just been given the same haircut all 4 times.  I HATE THAT!  I'm not a hair stylist.  I know most people are stuck in their old ways and never like to change their hair; however, I am not.  I LOVE getting new hair cuts.  I love going from long to short...or from short to growing it out.  I like change - especially with the seasons!  Give me some edge!  Make me look sexy!   (I never feel this way leaving this salon).
Plus, every time I have gone for a cut and color, I feel like it has gotten more expensive every single time.  I don't know what I'm being charged for...but my first session was a little under $120.  This past time it was up to $175 and like I said, I only go for a cut and color.  So I don't understand why my appointment is $55 more than it was 6 weeks before (and 6 weeks before I actually bought PRODUCT!).
After 4 sessions, I can now say that I'll CANT WAIT to be going back to Stephan Szabo's in Peters!  That's worth the drive, the price, the experience, and the feeling of newness and pretty confidence!"	review	RsaEvod4EOBYIdbRBBv0sw	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 5, u'cool': 0}	3.53	{u'funny': 3, u'plain': 19, u'writer': 8, u'note': 7, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 8, u'more': 3, u'cool': 22}	[]	3	[_7Lg8iTWpFc0O7PEA8FmbQ, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, JEvkfVPf_DuhX-ntE5L6bQ, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, BqneQTJGMnOV0mMOubuJdw, v8hWtY3W4e5tbEpgIxXxtA, 0Mt0JgKEI-XCxL2B2S_7GQ, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, Bq-4Wan0Y2klBlgqWWaEjA, ILquUgLlW7UiMNLakuW4Yg, olKIOr2PVh0gLcblu2ZONg, KIKpKZ3E3kY3VKs78iCN4w, lJsCDFtnR2-AMhDdWtCRug, zQHsfQovvIihgqpc7Q_x4A, rfJDc0W9Q-6q_AuFsWVeKA, ylIgegaQaJOjL4_lH2EkFA, N8VUPAhqFIk7zkoJ9qCjJg, CHw1HVGJE0fDY_-5keDKGw, fKaImMGusDVL7PhavCBcyA, xr8TpNtlTeQHanEN3d1X4g, -4Syq_RZeOUUezWkzFENIw, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 17qIR84XeVfKgP3YxRZrxw, EPZy7ePjyQyn9dPnxdqnGA, t72PB0Q0zl0WQpzu-kSPiw, fmLy0uc--ttSKfxlJ7LtCw, AW1uo4FhHPYz0kt6yfSeyA, xHDuNWPNO_2R2nlQ4w10BA, hc0fQgxP-kDQSP5UDdk3dA, 9N-rrqOdKCld2BD9hyXj5w, BAsVehg3YrqW84iIOhwfIg, ro2jM0RFGriJjbeFZrPGSw]	Caitlin	36	user	{u'funny': 31, u'useful': 98, u'cool': 27}	2011-04

But Still - Lidia's is one of the few restaurants on mine and Jordan's list, where one of us has been employed, but we will still willingly eat at.  Lidia's is our choice when we want great Italian foods that taste as close to our family making it as possible.
The other night we went for drinks and apps at the bar.  This is always fun for us because the Fritto Misto is fried veggies and calamari in a light batter, with their sauce for dipping.  And Lidia is the queen of sauce recipes!  We also had the appetizer version of the pasta-tasting platter because there is no way to walk into that building and NOT get the pasta-tasting trio in some form or another.  It's just AMAZING!
Our favorite time to go is for Saturday or Sunday Brunch.  I don't know why - but I think Lidia's Brunch is Pittsburgh's best kept brunch secret.  For $24.99 per person, you get a complimentary Bloody Mary or Mimosa to start, then you are brought your basket of scones, donuts, and breads accompanied by sweet butters.  Then you go up to the Anti-Pasta tables for veggies, egg frittatas, meats, salads, soups - its the ANTI-PASTA table!  Use your imagination (they use theirs!).  Then you order your Brunch Entree - whether that's the Pasta-Tasting trio or Filet & Eggs or Salmon.  After your Entree - you get to go up to their dessert table that always has tiramisu, Italian cookies, mousse, etc.  People give me their brunch suggestions all the time and NO ONE has beaten Lidia's.  Saturdays AND Sundays from 11a-2p.

At CMU they offer super inexpensive lunches that are more filling than anywhere else to eat at lunch. During this winter break, we have been going through some serious withdraw while the cafe is closed.

Thank you YELPERS once again, in our search to satiate our curry addiction, we have found our distributor!  We were excited to read that this restaurant supplied our weekly lunches and we ordered!!

I ordered the Alu Matar Mushroom at a spicy rating of 3 (yes, I'm a sissy), but it was EXACTLY what I wanted!!  Jordan ordered Alu Gobhi which was cauliflower & potato at a spicy rating of 5.  We truly weren't sure how to scale our tolerance; but we decided that next time we could both go hotter.

We also can't wait to try the Lunch Buffet! We really wish we would have known that this existed during the week in between Christmas & New Years when we were fiending for Indian food.  Now that we know, I have no doubt we will soon become regulars.

We have also tried Tamarind in Oakland, but that place just made my mouth go numb after it was all said and done (and left me with an unpleasant digestion experience).  All of the bad cliche things you hear about Indian food, is nothing like Taste of India.  You can taste the love cooked in."	review	RsaEvod4EOBYIdbRBBv0sw	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 5, u'cool': 2}	3.53	{u'funny': 3, u'plain': 19, u'writer': 8, u'note': 7, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 8, u'more': 3, u'cool': 22}	[]	3	[_7Lg8iTWpFc0O7PEA8FmbQ, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, JEvkfVPf_DuhX-ntE5L6bQ, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, BqneQTJGMnOV0mMOubuJdw, v8hWtY3W4e5tbEpgIxXxtA, 0Mt0JgKEI-XCxL2B2S_7GQ, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, Bq-4Wan0Y2klBlgqWWaEjA, ILquUgLlW7UiMNLakuW4Yg, olKIOr2PVh0gLcblu2ZONg, KIKpKZ3E3kY3VKs78iCN4w, lJsCDFtnR2-AMhDdWtCRug, zQHsfQovvIihgqpc7Q_x4A, rfJDc0W9Q-6q_AuFsWVeKA, ylIgegaQaJOjL4_lH2EkFA, N8VUPAhqFIk7zkoJ9qCjJg, CHw1HVGJE0fDY_-5keDKGw, fKaImMGusDVL7PhavCBcyA, xr8TpNtlTeQHanEN3d1X4g, -4Syq_RZeOUUezWkzFENIw, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 17qIR84XeVfKgP3YxRZrxw, EPZy7ePjyQyn9dPnxdqnGA, t72PB0Q0zl0WQpzu-kSPiw, fmLy0uc--ttSKfxlJ7LtCw, AW1uo4FhHPYz0kt6yfSeyA, xHDuNWPNO_2R2nlQ4w10BA, hc0fQgxP-kDQSP5UDdk3dA, 9N-rrqOdKCld2BD9hyXj5w, BAsVehg3YrqW84iIOhwfIg, ro2jM0RFGriJjbeFZrPGSw]	Caitlin	36	user	{u'funny': 31, u'useful': 98, u'cool': 27}	2011-04

The menu has your everyday American items; nothing too creative or imaginative.   It's pretty basic.  Salads, sandwiches, burgers and entrees we have all had before.
The food is good though; however you're paying for the location and decor (which, in our opinion, was kind of out-dated).  We started with the mushroom flatbread that was a bit on the sweet side; however it was loaded with mushrooms which is a huge plus.
I had the walnut crusted salmon sandwich and Jordan had the reuben.  The salmon was very light and tasty and Jordan's corned beef was sliced real thick.  French fries are pretty standard.
All in all, I guess this is where the rich people of ShadySide get their diner food: same kind of food, just a fancier ambiance than Denny's.

What a great suggestion 61C Cafe is because of my one criteria:  GREAT coffee, was met!  I do consider myself a Foodie, but I consider myself a Coffee SNOB!  Yes - I like my coffee hot and black, without the bastardization of sugars, creams, syrups, and foams.
When I pulled up - I immediately liked the exterior as it looks like an old coffee shop from the 60's.  But upon going inside, it's very warm, cozy, and simple.   No schticky decorations or fake histories on the walls.  
When I ordered a large cup of Dark Roast, they were actually at the bottom of the caraffe, so the barista asked if I wanted it, or if I would be willing to wait for a fresh pot.  (Duh!  Coffee Snob!  Wait for a fresh pot!)
I took a seat and started reading a book while waiting for my coffee, when the barista brought my coffee over to me a few minutes later and said with a genuine smile, ""You can pay when you're ready!""  I paid $2 for a LARGE CUP OF COFFEE!!!  $2!!!  AMAZING!!!!  I tipped him another $2 for being so awesome!
Another great thing about this place, the clientele are awesome too and are not pretentious, too hipster, or too trendy.  Just people drinking coffee, passing time, and reading books.  When I asked my table neighbor to watch my bag while I went to put another quarter in the meter, when I returned we actually had a great conversation!
I didn't get a chance to taste the biscotti or the baked goodies, but definitely on my next stop.  Great coffee.  Great Atmosphere.  Great People.  Great Prices.

I stopped by the Kings Family Restaurant prior to grocery shopping.    I have never been to a Kings Family Restaurant since moving to Pittsburgh.   There are several local establishments.

This particular location has pretty good food at a great price.   It is similar to a Cracker Barrel and / or Bob Evans.   I ordered something very hearty - Country Fried Steak , Eggs, and Cheesy Potatoes.

The food and coffee were good.    The service was excellent. 

I will go back.

As the other fellower yelpers mentioned - this place is a cash only.    A couple of recommendations:

- Don't eat early in the week 
- I don't recommend wearing any tight clothing (no skinny jeans) - you will not be skinny when you leave


 I walked in for breakfast one early weekday AM.   The place was packed with locals and regulars.    A very good sign.

My co-worker recommended I get the mixed grill.   I ordered the large mix grill.   My waitress tried to warn me - it is large (very large).    I ended up eating the left-overs for the next 2 days.

Food - 

The Mixed Grill comprises their homemade sausage, grilled onions, grilled peppers, potatoes, fried eggs.     

Portion -

This should have been a man vs food episode.   I was not going to attempt to eat all the food.   It was really good.

Service - 

My waitress looks as if she had been working there for years.   She was fast, friendly, and offered good advice.

Price - 

The cost ranges $5 - 10.

When I look at Yelp reviews, I usually weed out the outliers (the best and the worst).   Unfortunately, there are only two reviews.

It was my first time at the office.   The office admin (very nice) asked for me to come early (before 9am) to complete paperwork.   I arrived at 8:50.    I waited.   I watched 2 employees walk by me (unlocked the door and re-locked it).    They did not acknowledge me.

The door I was at had signage (open hours).    I decided to leave because of a review where the staff seemed distracted or disinterested in my presence.

The office admin (very nice) called me to inform I am missing my appointment.   I explained to her that there were too many indications where this was not going to be a good fit and wished her the best of luck.

I recommend if you see this dentist you go to the front door (furthest away from the parking lot) for the entrance.

Poor recommendation because the staff who walked by me seemed to be distracted which was pointed out in a previous review."	review	Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 1}	3.79	{u'profile': 3, u'funny': 5, u'plain': 14, u'writer': 13, u'list': 2, u'note': 5, u'photos': 4, u'hot': 17, u'more': 3, u'cool': 26}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, jlpbR7IurKHCnSrGxELVlg, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, j95HloXgQiHWDdkkHwytlQ, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, wYtCAzpt8fh9Cn2TOEq20A, GAeM4pken2drf7CpuKHuLg, esvHlasGQyQlRoshdxeNzA, HEP2vvehNWdsqUsaV0Ti4A, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, K_nrZRDnIM1LH1HPVX1_6Q, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, cT60APDQLgJZ6atLZPz1VA, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, fKaImMGusDVL7PhavCBcyA, hru2IDwSyN61sgWPtJw_hA, yE1EwlvQ8eTH3MZ6NzFflA, 5RwLnaIiIdldkjdCL-eYYg, 9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ, GYNfjDbSlpdRK2qC8RqatA, CP6h_-UpWdvx6BMxMAEINw, O-Z8vRn1G9JVQHyxmyBKEw, bo44a1GZjIXSp1lQ45CukQ, q4vX0J94v-YsUbim1RZbjw, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, qezuW5Y1_wxwMceSMSvcVA, c_Io9x7pqQVCPMydBOtfnQ, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA, NH8aEIKCSO_xtp54zrMoTg, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	Patrick	370	user	{u'funny': 167, u'useful': 530, u'cool': 248}	2011-03

I happen to be in the Homestead area for work.   I really wanted to dig into my Yelp bag of tricks provided by local Yelpers and introduce my team to the ""Shock and Awe"" they deserved but ... the shear numbers would made it hard.

When I started thinking about how we would have a manageable lunch - The only idea I could come up with was the Golden Corral - I knew that was not going to work for me.

We decided to do something local and walking distance - D&B was it.

It is what you expect - quiet for lunch video games and a bar nearby but I had to forgo any festivities - it was a work lunch.   I was pleased they had a under 600 calorie menu.   I am trying to maintain a normal diet due to my stretchy pants being out of style and not wanting to look like a character out of Family Guy.

The waitress was very friendly and organized.    I ordered the Cabo style Chicken - Chicken Breast lightly seasoned and char-grilled, topped with pineapple pico de gallo and served with spicy rice and steamed fresh vegetables.

It was eh...   The chicken was cooked but the pineapple pico de gallo was bland.  The rice was bland.  The vegetables were cold.   I really blame it on the fact I was with 15 compatriots for lunch so I am giving it a fair rating.  Everything was edible.

My team went with deep fried foods and burgers.   They seemed pleased.

Service - very good
Food - okay, not great.   My meal was $13
Ambiance - well it was clean but there were not really any people in D&B

They only have tables where you can stand and eat.   They make everything on the premises.   We ate in.   I ordered the Hot Italian Sausage Sandwich and some side meatballs.    The food was awesome!.

All items were made from scratch.    My eggs benedict was very good.   The meal came with ham and layered over toast.   It was quite messy but I enjoyed it.

My friend enjoyed her Meatloaf Sandwich and Mash Potatoes.

Food - Very good - I cannot wait to go back and try some pancakes!
Service - Good - The waitress was crazy busy.   I did have a longer wait than desired (just be aware when you want your check).
Price - everything is between $5-10 on average per meal.

I love Mad Mex and all the offerings.   My favorites are the Wing-o-rito and Gobble-rito(when offered).

The Wing-o-rito has your beloved wing sauce mixed in their hefty burrito.

The Gobble-rito is their seasonal Thanksgiving burrito with a side of cranberry.

Both are awesome!   Schedule your training appointments or your purge because these are high-calorie affairs but worth it.   Top it off with one of their signature drinks and you cannot go wrong :)

There aer 2 standup gambling syle video game machines (think space invaders but they are are called ""Magical Odds and the other one is not named but has is a memory game.

The place is very friendly.    

I ordered the wedding soup and the Spinach Gnocchi with a Crown and Diet Coke- I needed a drink after driving the hot wheels track known as Downtown Pittsburgh - I think my GPS needed a drink too ;-)...

My wedding soup arrived and I felt it was a littel under seasoned but that is something I can definitely add - no dings here.

The Gnocchi arrived and it was quite tasty.     The pasta was done right - I had felt like I was eating spinach dumplings.    I orignally was going to request a meat but this meal needed none of that nonsense.

They have a lunchtime buffet that looked good but I wanted to try something made fresh for my first stop.

Overall - I like this place

Service - Great - super friendly

The pizza is pretty good - I like mine a little more well done (must pass the stand test).    They use fresh ingredients.    

I think what made the place for me is the wine bar.   Awesome bartender / awesome crowd.    I liked the fireplace in the wine bar (especially on a negative degree night).

- Pizza
- Meatball Appetizers

This place is theme decorated (to a particular holiday) for lengthy period of time.   Example - January - they were still in their Christmas Theme.   The sensory overload on the decorations within the bar is very amusing similar to the feeling you have when you are looking at a house decorated with 10,000 Christmas lights.     Some of the pictures on Yelp do not do the place justice.


This particular night was our third stop and it was Karaoke Night.    The place had a great vibe.

My only knock on this place is that they still allow smoking.   Beware if you are not used to smokers because your sinuses will go into overdrive.

We arrived on a Saturday Afternoon for lunch and some beers.    I had read up on this place and was pretty amped to drink beer in a church.    I had read many good things about on Yelp.

I like this place but was not overwhelmed (more like undewhelmed :-( - I had high expectations)  There is nothing wrong with the establishment and i will go back.

They make their own beer in this big church.   I ordered quite a few and found the beers to be ""okay"".   My Pitt Native friend mentioned to me that his favorite beer was not currently available so I will need to revisit and rewrite my review.

Food - We ordered a couple of small pizzas.   The first pizza we tried was the Pirogie pizza.   It was pretty much flavorless (pizza, no sauce, with mash potato dumpings, covered with cheese)...   I had higher expectations.   The second pizza was pretty good.  Please note in Pittsburgh - there are some good pubs that serve great pizza - this is not one of those pubs.

All and all - nothing was bad but nothing was great.    I will be back and try some more items and rewrite my review."	review	Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 1}	3.79	{u'profile': 3, u'funny': 5, u'plain': 14, u'writer': 13, u'list': 2, u'note': 5, u'photos': 4, u'hot': 17, u'more': 3, u'cool': 26}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, jlpbR7IurKHCnSrGxELVlg, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, j95HloXgQiHWDdkkHwytlQ, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, wYtCAzpt8fh9Cn2TOEq20A, GAeM4pken2drf7CpuKHuLg, esvHlasGQyQlRoshdxeNzA, HEP2vvehNWdsqUsaV0Ti4A, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, K_nrZRDnIM1LH1HPVX1_6Q, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, cT60APDQLgJZ6atLZPz1VA, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, fKaImMGusDVL7PhavCBcyA, hru2IDwSyN61sgWPtJw_hA, yE1EwlvQ8eTH3MZ6NzFflA, 5RwLnaIiIdldkjdCL-eYYg, 9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ, GYNfjDbSlpdRK2qC8RqatA, CP6h_-UpWdvx6BMxMAEINw, O-Z8vRn1G9JVQHyxmyBKEw, bo44a1GZjIXSp1lQ45CukQ, q4vX0J94v-YsUbim1RZbjw, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, qezuW5Y1_wxwMceSMSvcVA, c_Io9x7pqQVCPMydBOtfnQ, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA, NH8aEIKCSO_xtp54zrMoTg, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	Patrick	370	user	{u'funny': 167, u'useful': 530, u'cool': 248}	2011-03

We did get our comedy for the day at this place.   When the bartender ran a purse out of the establishment to give to another person (who she thought left it).   The funny thing was that it was not that person's purse.

Any way the beers were cold and tasty.  We did not eat there but others were.    they have a spin wheel which determines the shot you will need to drink.

I would go back but be warned - this place will get much younger as the night progresses.

Atmosphere - Traditional Pub during the day - good craft beer selection - easy going / fun

Cost - normal - about $5 per craft beer

Service - Great - Our server was great.

This bar reminded me of a Mt Adams (Cincy) / Short North (Columbus).   The place had great Craft Beers (what place in Pittsburgh does not).   They had a chalkboard with all the beer listings and food listings.

This bar is located in Etna (I believe) and is across a factory / industrial place.   (I was actually lost - welcome to Pittsburgh - the Hot Wheels track of America).    I noticed several cars parked along and on a sidewalk and understood why.    

The bar is actually pretty updated (natural woods) and full of locals.    My buddy and I sat at the bar.   I ordered a Rooney Beer (How Pittsburgh can you get... well Iron City, Penn Brewery, etc.. but a Rooney Beer has to be right up there :-))    

This place had a great crowd for a Saturday afternoon - It is very much a gathering for Sports Events (Penguins just finished I believe)

The bartender was extremely friendly.   The locals were extremely friendly.    If I get an opportunity, I will go back.

Atmosphere - Great - Local, Blue Collar Clean Establishment
Prices - Great - I just ordered Beer but the price ranges from $2.75 + depending on what you get
Food - I did not try but I believe they serve food.  Maybe next time

Great people, good beer, and tons of character / atmopshere for the event.   Penn Brewery throws a great party.   I have been to some pretty large Oktoberfest (Cincinnati) where all of downtown is closed.    This place had all the character and fun as the larger festivals.

The place was packed - always a good sign.   The beer was awesome.   I did not try the food - but it looked good as well.

Beer - Great Variety, Good Value, and Great Service (Served by the brewmasters themself)

Alright this is the wrong song but the food here was fantastic.   I had some folks in town and decided to adventure the Strip District.   I picked the wrong time (after 6pm).    I quickly accessed my Yelp 911 app on my phone and found Kaya a few steps away.

We walked in and were met by the Hostess.  She explained the place was completely booked for the evening with reservations.   She did mention we could eat at the bar.   There were just enough spots for our group.

I knew this was going to be a long night so I was wearling my big boy pants and was ready for some festivities.   I ordered our group some drinks and appetizers.   

I am used to beer and wine flights.   Kaya offers Rum flights.    I boarded this pupply and went on the smokey flight while my friends went on the sweet and traditional flight.   We had a great pairing of appetizers (corn and lentil beignets, mango salsa, and calamari).

The dinner  - I ordered the Flank Steak (recommended by the bartender).   It was marinated for 2 days!  The steak was very tender and the meal was awesome.


Atmosphere:   Very trendy with lots of people.   Awesome atmosphere
Price;  Price can run you for an entree anywhere from $15-25 on average
Food:  Great , wow, yummy ...

I strongly recommend this place.  I hope you like it as much as I did.

Well not really but I decided to head there for their 100 yr anniversary.   It was my first time and I was impressed if I wanted to buy some fresh fish.

I took my buddy there who was from out of town to share the experience.   We joined the line to order our food that started out the door.   I was confused because there is a Sushi Line and a separate line for the cooked variety.

One of the rubs - they were out of many things (Calamari, shrimp, etc...)    I could not try the assortment I wanted.

I ordered.  We received an abudance of food.    The fish was cooked very well.   The sides were done very well.

A second rub was the atmosphere.  You are in a fish market where they sell fresh fish.   After about 10 minutes in line, the smell is not the best (atleast for my appetite).    Once we received our food, we waited to pay (food getting cooler by the minute).

We paid and made the trek upstairs to eat.

I will do it again, I am sure."	review	Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.79	{u'profile': 3, u'funny': 5, u'plain': 14, u'writer': 13, u'list': 2, u'note': 5, u'photos': 4, u'hot': 17, u'more': 3, u'cool': 26}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	8	[UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, jlpbR7IurKHCnSrGxELVlg, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, j95HloXgQiHWDdkkHwytlQ, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg, wYtCAzpt8fh9Cn2TOEq20A, GAeM4pken2drf7CpuKHuLg, esvHlasGQyQlRoshdxeNzA, HEP2vvehNWdsqUsaV0Ti4A, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, K_nrZRDnIM1LH1HPVX1_6Q, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, cT60APDQLgJZ6atLZPz1VA, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, fKaImMGusDVL7PhavCBcyA, hru2IDwSyN61sgWPtJw_hA, yE1EwlvQ8eTH3MZ6NzFflA, 5RwLnaIiIdldkjdCL-eYYg, 9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ, GYNfjDbSlpdRK2qC8RqatA, CP6h_-UpWdvx6BMxMAEINw, O-Z8vRn1G9JVQHyxmyBKEw, bo44a1GZjIXSp1lQ45CukQ, q4vX0J94v-YsUbim1RZbjw, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, qezuW5Y1_wxwMceSMSvcVA, c_Io9x7pqQVCPMydBOtfnQ, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA, NH8aEIKCSO_xtp54zrMoTg, WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA]	Patrick	370	user	{u'funny': 167, u'useful': 530, u'cool': 248}	2011-03

I think every sandwich should have pierogies on them.    I have heard about this place since I arrived in Pittsburgh.   We gave the hostess our number and proceeded to the bar.

They have a great beer selection.    We had a couple of beers and then were alerted our table was ready.    

They have a large menu with burgers, sandwiches, etc...    Many items needed to be tried by me and now I have another reason to come back.

I orderd the Southside ... Sandwich - It was yummy.    This is a layered sandwich with sausage, pierogies and onions.     Very good flavor.     It was served witht heir housemade chips.

Service - Very Good - our waitress knew her beers and provided good recommendations.

Food - Fantastic - the sandwich was really good.   The sandwiches run $10 - 15  per... It is worth it.

Atmosphere - this place is crowded and has a great vibe.    Please note their side room gets very warm in my opinion.    (I believe this serves as their outdoor section in the summer)

My wife had her bridal shower here and her guests loved it.  It was different than the typical, stale shower; plus everyone got a discount that day to shop the store.

They have all kind of gourmet gadgets & appliances that you'd see in Williams-Sonoma but the prices are a little better, I think.  The staff is super helpful and will go out of their way to help you.  Look for their All-Clad ""seconds"" sales.  This is when All-Clad merchandise is on sale that has minor (and I mean minor) defects.  You can get top notch pots and pans at half the price.

I have been disappointed often times with the ""performance"" of the chef.  From an entertainment perspective, I've seen better, but the most important aspect is the food and I've always had it well prepared.  

The drinks are well mixed in my experience.  I even ordered the one with the glowing ice cube once, which was great, if only for the ice cube and ensuing ridicule.  They offer a limited wine selection, but there are 1 or 2 decent options by the glass.

The place is definitely packed all the time, which either makes for good people watching or is sure to annoy you -- it depends what kind of person you are.  I happen to enjoy the crowd.  The bathroom attendant is a bit much though.

The appetizer bar is hit and miss, some things are good, but others are just ok.  There's always a salad option, and they've added a cheese tray which is welcome.  They have pasta available and you can put your choice of sauce on top.  If you want to can just order the app bar, and there is enough there to make a meal, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price.

For a place named after salmon, I'd say theirs is only a little better than average.  I've had black cod here a few times (a more recent menu addition) and it's very good.  

As far as wine goes, their selection is really weak considering they are branded as a wine bar.  Also, the prices are not good.  You can do much better elsewhere.

For a nice dinner before a Hockey Night in Pittsburgh, I prefer The Carlton because you get your parking taken care of and the wine selection is much more expansive and better priced."	review	072tu2_MFWmw-jb1O6DQYg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.98	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 10, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 31, u'writer': 25, u'list': 1, u'note': 14, u'photos': 7, u'hot': 28, u'cool': 39, u'more': 4}	[2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[CQqb9nCO55w8I6vwzide5g, Q8KFcuPwUh2v6BMTyFFyBw, 68ymiEBUgddjV_2Jijr4mA, 3NEZvGl12UVuJcUzAfhAnw, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, jVLMfm2v2U49y6Sjlm_EeA, ED6n40WmZJm0AvsKkG7iaw, YgZAE8MzNg_i3LljhvnOKQ, Vv6DYMiNXX6tYeLCvOAxSg, aQYNUROkOwPxEe-TMxtvPw, NawKd2FCoCPL_pdUgEb6vQ, sbPbPDWwCG9lfmYTb4gVTA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, NijLLpheTJ9ITlVjWnqulg, Ud5qGcDIbPMUW7gVg0Kchw, 4A3dQlNtdL8uaMgXbHIEHg, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, hNjNdeBk_uXsaVfkGlXJrg, _96O9eRDEG-A15ZD4OrYSw, aLHGl0Cyixgt2-qOgSTRKQ, nGQByOczXm8rvaJjkR9I5w, R0iP9B7gPpsed68_23J05A, OHICNNk3Vu319t3JtmO5nQ, fvJFyB_JcBBqQTiWxM_HWQ, SImk0pYFXa0xrJL7sA7PWg]	Matt	525	user	{u'funny': 171, u'useful': 964, u'cool': 313}	2009-09

Definitely dress casually because you could get pooped on or have some water drip from the ceiling. There are lots of hands-on opportunities, especially for children; be sure to bring a wad of $1 bills to drop in the donation bucket to take advantage of the feeding opportunities.

The penguin exhibit is the most intimate I've seen around, which is of course a great highlight in the Pittsburgh area. The outdoor condor exhibit was closed for winter and another outdoor display was vacant.

We paid the extra $5 for the Parrots of the Caribbean show. It was predictably corny and a few of the animals weren't interested in performing. I can't fault them (they are animals!), but I will say that show was probably best for little kids. Older attendees without kids might just want to skip the show and save the money for something else.

The cafe is more like a snack shop, despite the name brand sponsorship from Atria's. We had a loaded baked potato soup that was really good, but don't expect to get much of a meal here. Most of the offerings are things you'd see at a sporting event (chicken strips, pretzels, nacho chips, etc). They offer a few salads, but I can't vouch for the quality.

Bring your camera! Photography is encouraged in all areas except the show. Flashes are OK too. You can get some really great photos.

I had the lamb and it was sublime. Juicy, rich in flavor, extraordinary. A must try!

The sommelier was helpful in picking out exactly what I wanted. I found a wine on the list that I very much enjoy, but wanted to try something new but similar. He found a wine that had many of the same characteristics but of a completely different region (South American vs. my familiar Italian bottle). *That's* what fine dining is all about.

Their dessert menu had so many fun choices. We were quite satiated, but had to give them a try. If you're a little budget conscious and intimidated by the cost of a full meal, make a late reservation and just come for dessert! You won't be disappointed.

I had a bone-in filet cooked to medium rare perfection. The lobster mac n cheese and asparagus were our sides. They are family style portions, and given the richness of everything you'll be having, you won't need more than two or three sides for a party of four (and you'll have leftovers, too).

The portions in general are very ""classic steakhouse"" big. I also had a wedge salad, which was not too heavy on the dressing and everything was fresh as you'd like.

The wine list is HUGE and there are plenty of selections at all price points. My wife and I split a half bottle (next to last page). 

My brother pointed something out about the prices. While this place is not cheap, it seems that similar quality steak, salads, sides, and appetizers cost about 20% more on The Strip.

Yeah, this isn't Cedar Point or Disney World, but it's still fantastic.  Obviously, I've got a lot of nostalgia from growing up here and going every year for the ""school picnic"" in May, but this is a fun time for anyone.  If you're not from the Burgh, but you've ever watched one of those Top 10 Rollercoaster shows on Discovery Channel, chances are you've seen Kennywood.  Also, the movie ""Adventureland"" with Michael Cera was filmed here.

The highlights:

1. The fries at the Potato Patch - Great any way you like them!
2. The Thunderbolt, Jackrabbit, and Racer - old school wooden roller coasters FTW!
3. Noah's Ark - If you can't hear that whistle when I say Kennywood Noah's Ark, then you didn't grow up in Pittsburgh!
4. The landscaping
5. People watching (esp. if you enjoy fashion faux pas!)

Someone mentioned the ""Garfieldization"" of the Old Mill.  It's definitely not cool.  Kennywood was recently sold to a parent company (from out of the USA; maybe Mexico) and I hope that doesn't mean there's going to be a lot of changes made to the traditional park feel.  Kennywood isn't a Six Flags or Paramount Park, and that's what makes it great.

Our service was really poor. The restaurant was 85-95% full at the tables, but there were seats at the burger bar. The server was slow to get around to take our order and just didn't seem like she wanted to be there or help us.

The zucchini fries were just okay. People were really all about them in reviews, but the breading wasn't much more than basic bar provolone stick breading. A few times the zucchini inside just slipped out leaving a sheath of uninteresting breading. Not awesome. The sweet potato fries were very good and the mac n cheese bites were good, but I seriously think it was just Kraft mac n cheese that was fried. That's not a complaint because I have a nostalgic fondness for that, and I have to say at least it was full of mac n cheese. Some fried mac n cheese I've had (like at state fairs) is mostly just breading.

For my burger, I was very undecided. I went with the natural source beef with brie, the red wine reduction sauce, mushrooms, and carmelized onions. It was appetizing and filling, but the bottom of my bun deteriorated. I went with the plain bun; maybe others are more substantial. I ended up eating the last half of my burger with a fork. Medium is more like medium rare. This doesn't bother me, but FYI in case you expect your burgers to be more cooked through.  

The TV in our booth was not in our control, though the server did get the staff to change it. The TV was beat up with a good 20% section of poor/damaged pixels.

Our milkshake was the best part.

Not the worst meal I've had, but not good enough to make me come back."	review	072tu2_MFWmw-jb1O6DQYg	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 1}	3.98	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 10, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 31, u'writer': 25, u'list': 1, u'note': 14, u'photos': 7, u'hot': 28, u'cool': 39, u'more': 4}	[2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[CQqb9nCO55w8I6vwzide5g, Q8KFcuPwUh2v6BMTyFFyBw, 68ymiEBUgddjV_2Jijr4mA, 3NEZvGl12UVuJcUzAfhAnw, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, jVLMfm2v2U49y6Sjlm_EeA, ED6n40WmZJm0AvsKkG7iaw, YgZAE8MzNg_i3LljhvnOKQ, Vv6DYMiNXX6tYeLCvOAxSg, aQYNUROkOwPxEe-TMxtvPw, NawKd2FCoCPL_pdUgEb6vQ, sbPbPDWwCG9lfmYTb4gVTA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, NijLLpheTJ9ITlVjWnqulg, Ud5qGcDIbPMUW7gVg0Kchw, 4A3dQlNtdL8uaMgXbHIEHg, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, hNjNdeBk_uXsaVfkGlXJrg, _96O9eRDEG-A15ZD4OrYSw, aLHGl0Cyixgt2-qOgSTRKQ, nGQByOczXm8rvaJjkR9I5w, R0iP9B7gPpsed68_23J05A, OHICNNk3Vu319t3JtmO5nQ, fvJFyB_JcBBqQTiWxM_HWQ, SImk0pYFXa0xrJL7sA7PWg]	Matt	525	user	{u'funny': 171, u'useful': 964, u'cool': 313}	2009-09

It's not a cheap lunch, but frankly, it's only a few bucks more than you'll pay elsewhere. At least Mesa Grill will be delicious and memorable. You should be able to just walk up for lunch unless it's a crazy busy time in Vegas. I'd recommend reservations for dinner.

The burgers! Margaritas! Everything is great. This is also a great dinner spot, too. I love the rub on the burgers and steaks. The location is right next to the the Caesars sports book. If you're seated right, you might be able to watch a game on the sports book TVs through the glass."	review	072tu2_MFWmw-jb1O6DQYg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.98	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 10, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 31, u'writer': 25, u'list': 1, u'note': 14, u'photos': 7, u'hot': 28, u'cool': 39, u'more': 4}	[2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[CQqb9nCO55w8I6vwzide5g, Q8KFcuPwUh2v6BMTyFFyBw, 68ymiEBUgddjV_2Jijr4mA, 3NEZvGl12UVuJcUzAfhAnw, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, jVLMfm2v2U49y6Sjlm_EeA, ED6n40WmZJm0AvsKkG7iaw, YgZAE8MzNg_i3LljhvnOKQ, Vv6DYMiNXX6tYeLCvOAxSg, aQYNUROkOwPxEe-TMxtvPw, NawKd2FCoCPL_pdUgEb6vQ, sbPbPDWwCG9lfmYTb4gVTA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, NijLLpheTJ9ITlVjWnqulg, Ud5qGcDIbPMUW7gVg0Kchw, 4A3dQlNtdL8uaMgXbHIEHg, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, hNjNdeBk_uXsaVfkGlXJrg, _96O9eRDEG-A15ZD4OrYSw, aLHGl0Cyixgt2-qOgSTRKQ, nGQByOczXm8rvaJjkR9I5w, R0iP9B7gPpsed68_23J05A, OHICNNk3Vu319t3JtmO5nQ, fvJFyB_JcBBqQTiWxM_HWQ, SImk0pYFXa0xrJL7sA7PWg]	Matt	525	user	{u'funny': 171, u'useful': 964, u'cool': 313}	2009-09

I've been back to Vegas and stayed many other places, but I have to say Bellagio is my favorite hotel/casino. I love the ambiance an color of the casino floor. The restaurants are excellent (Circo, Prime are my favorites) and it just feels timelessly classic. I know Wynn and Encore are newer and now there's the Cosmopolitan and others, but I think Bellagio will stand the test of time."	review	072tu2_MFWmw-jb1O6DQYg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.98	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 10, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 31, u'writer': 25, u'list': 1, u'note': 14, u'photos': 7, u'hot': 28, u'cool': 39, u'more': 4}	[2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[CQqb9nCO55w8I6vwzide5g, Q8KFcuPwUh2v6BMTyFFyBw, 68ymiEBUgddjV_2Jijr4mA, 3NEZvGl12UVuJcUzAfhAnw, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, jVLMfm2v2U49y6Sjlm_EeA, ED6n40WmZJm0AvsKkG7iaw, YgZAE8MzNg_i3LljhvnOKQ, Vv6DYMiNXX6tYeLCvOAxSg, aQYNUROkOwPxEe-TMxtvPw, NawKd2FCoCPL_pdUgEb6vQ, sbPbPDWwCG9lfmYTb4gVTA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, NijLLpheTJ9ITlVjWnqulg, Ud5qGcDIbPMUW7gVg0Kchw, 4A3dQlNtdL8uaMgXbHIEHg, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, hNjNdeBk_uXsaVfkGlXJrg, _96O9eRDEG-A15ZD4OrYSw, aLHGl0Cyixgt2-qOgSTRKQ, nGQByOczXm8rvaJjkR9I5w, R0iP9B7gPpsed68_23J05A, OHICNNk3Vu319t3JtmO5nQ, fvJFyB_JcBBqQTiWxM_HWQ, SImk0pYFXa0xrJL7sA7PWg]	Matt	525	user	{u'funny': 171, u'useful': 964, u'cool': 313}	2009-09
401	ripCiWZ0MblMZSLrIKQAKA	2014-06-18	wQ34UPi5j6uoYo74Hitwng	3	"For what we paid, this was good value. I've paid much more for a comparable room at Caesars Palace, so I was happy here. I've outlined the pros and cons below. We just had a one-night stay (Thursday), but for $48 plus resort fee (MLife rate) it was worthwhile. The room was simple, but spacious. The furnishings were a bit dated and worn, but it was fine.  The hotel's branding calls it ""Unpretentiously Luxurious."" Depending on your perception of luxury, that is a pretty fair slogan.

On the meh side, the HD tv featured no HD channels. The shower is not well lit, but the bathroom was clean and functional. The check-in took about 30 minutes in  line and there were only 3 or 4 employees manning the desks, though there were stations for something like 15. If you are MLife gold or higher, look for the VIP services on the edge of the lobby toward the casino to check in.

We were upgraded to a Strip View room (27th floor of 32). The view of the Strip was minimal; you'll be mostly looking across to MGM Grand and Signature along with some of the lowest rent shops along the strip, or you'll be looking north at the towering Mandarin Oriental which blocks any view further up the Strip. I should have taken a photo to show you, but I didn't even think about it because it was so unremarkable. It was not a view worth paying for, but again, our upgrade was free. If this will be your first trip to Las Vegas and you really want a nice view of the Strip, look for another hotel.

My biggest complaint was that the people on our floor were loud in the hallways in the middle of the night. Yeah, it's Vegas, but have some decency. That's what I get for trying to stay on a cheap rate, I guess.

The best part was the pool. With a lazy river and a wave pool, you get a lot of options. The pool wasn't massive, but it needn't be. The water temperature was nice and the music was good. A DJ came in the afternoon and she mixed good songs but didn't become the center of attention of our afternoon at the pool.

The casino offers some $5 blackjack tables near the food court which is a nice option for the risk-averse or the parsimonious Yelper. Most of the other tables were $10 or $15, I think.

The Cafe was a good lunch spot for not too much coin. I had a nice ham and cheese sandwich with salt and vinegar chips and my wife enjoyed her meal, too. I can't remember what it was, but she liked it. Food here counts toward MLife points. It didn't seem to count at the Dragon Noodle house, but that was another good lunch option. The lunch specials are cheap but the food quality was much better than Panda Express.

Though the view in our room was meh, the hotel's location is good to many other hotels. You can catch the tram for a quick ride up to Bellagio if you're in the mood for something fancier.  With the cheap room rate and convenience to other hotels, this would be a good place to stay on the cheap if you want to spend your money on nice dinners and/or shows. There are cheaper hotels in the MLife family, but they get really, really sketchy (Luxor, Excalibur). Mirage or Mandalay Bay would be a notch up from Monte Carlo.

Another random note: Monte Carlo is one of the easiest to access from Las Vegas Blvd. That is, the driveway is not as complicated. This was a good advantage for us because my brother (a local) picked us up when he got back into town for the weekend. Also, being on the south end of the Strip makes it a  pretty quick to/from the airport."	review	072tu2_MFWmw-jb1O6DQYg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 4, u'cool': 0}	3.98	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 10, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 31, u'writer': 25, u'list': 1, u'note': 14, u'photos': 7, u'hot': 28, u'cool': 39, u'more': 4}	[2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[CQqb9nCO55w8I6vwzide5g, Q8KFcuPwUh2v6BMTyFFyBw, 68ymiEBUgddjV_2Jijr4mA, 3NEZvGl12UVuJcUzAfhAnw, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, jVLMfm2v2U49y6Sjlm_EeA, ED6n40WmZJm0AvsKkG7iaw, YgZAE8MzNg_i3LljhvnOKQ, Vv6DYMiNXX6tYeLCvOAxSg, aQYNUROkOwPxEe-TMxtvPw, NawKd2FCoCPL_pdUgEb6vQ, sbPbPDWwCG9lfmYTb4gVTA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, NijLLpheTJ9ITlVjWnqulg, Ud5qGcDIbPMUW7gVg0Kchw, 4A3dQlNtdL8uaMgXbHIEHg, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, hNjNdeBk_uXsaVfkGlXJrg, _96O9eRDEG-A15ZD4OrYSw, aLHGl0Cyixgt2-qOgSTRKQ, nGQByOczXm8rvaJjkR9I5w, R0iP9B7gPpsed68_23J05A, OHICNNk3Vu319t3JtmO5nQ, fvJFyB_JcBBqQTiWxM_HWQ, SImk0pYFXa0xrJL7sA7PWg]	Matt	525	user	{u'funny': 171, u'useful': 964, u'cool': 313}	2009-09

The heirloom tomato salad was so fresh, ripe and colorful. I've had heirloom salads before, but this was just perfect. That tomato salad is what earned the 5th star here. I can't say enough about it!!

The wine list and cocktail menu comes on an iPad. Frankly, I thought it was a little distracting, especially in the dimly lit restaurant. I think a paper list would have been sufficient.

Our servers were excellent, which you expect for the price you'll pay at a place like this.

Here's a little tip, especially if you're staying at the Signature. You will get a good amount of food here, and it is all very rich. Don't be bashful about getting the leftovers boxed up. They make for easy reheating and an excellent breakfast in the morning!

The chef was there to cook and not flip knives, just FYI.

Our suite was on the 19th floor, and we had more than enough space for two. The bathroom is probably the nicest part; there are two sinks, a giant bathtub, and a large shower. There is also an extra powder room accessible to the living room. The only downside in the room, as others have mentioned, is that the TVs are relatively old. They work though, even if the sound level is inconsistent and the picture quality is below the now expected HD level.

There is plenty of drawer space on both sides of the bed and in the armoire. The furnishings were in good shape, and the carpet was clean. The wireless internet access was more reliable than I've come to expect in many hotels. 

THEhotel location in the back of the property connects right near the sports book in the Mandalay Bay casino.  The Mandalay Shops are nearby as well. The lobby is decorated with dark wood and low lighting, and has a fresh spa fragrance. The staff was friendly and helpful. We used the concierge and my wife enjoyed a massage at the Spa. It was nice that the lobby area, with accompanying lounge and cafe was quiet since the casino is further down the hall. Very quiet and relaxing.

Our room was also very quiet. We were the first room on the hall, next to the ice machine. We never heard the ice machine. The only thing we could hear was the pipes of our neighbor getting the shower going in the morning. We never heard door slams or people in the hallway, etc.

Keep in mind that you will be charged a resort fee (~$30) in addition to your room rate. For this weekend, our average night (not including resort fee) was less than $110. Even with the resort fee, it was a good value.

I was a little leery of Mandalay Bay because it is all the way at the south end of The Strip. This actually worked in our favor this time because we rented a car. The access to the self-park is incredibly convenient, and we were able to get in and out of the hotel without any traffic challenges. In fact, we didn't even need to venture on to Las Vegas Blvd. Access to I-15 and 215 is very convenient. By foot, you can catch a tram to Excalibur, and Luxor is a quick walk through the Mandalay Shops. From Excalibur, you can walk around or through NY,NY and catch the next tram in Monte Carlo that will take you through City Center to Bellagio.

I would definitely recommend this hotel, especially to someone who has been to Vegas before and isn't worried about being right in the middle of everything. Take advantage of the accessibility to the roads and go see some off-Strip stuff like Hoover Dam, the Pinball Hall of Fame, and the off-Strip restaurants (better value with still very good food).

405	Sktj1eHQFuVa-M4bgnEh8g	2011-02-25	apM_3NdKNQjIjRLeFN7vOQ	4	This quaint mini golf course is one of the oldest, yet most original and fun locations that I have yet visited.  Coming from Texas, it was nice to see a course located amongst the hilly and woody Pennsylvanian terrain. It can be frustrating that it is literally impossible to make a hole-in-one on most every hole and that the course also makes it extremely difficult to predict the direction on how the ball will follow through and bounce.  The cartoon-like outrageousness of the course proved to give laughs and a fun attempt to play.  Improvements were being made and I will look forward to returning on my next visit to the Pittsburgh area.  I enjoy traveling and visiting new courses and the only reason why I didn't give this location 5 stars is because it was impossible to intuitively shoot the ball for a best effort to beat par.	review	5eR_TeDFbOmv28MoRwH-lw	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	4.5	{u'hot': 1}	[]	0	[e6f6ETqM6c-SF369w0wqDQ]	Mark	2	user	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 2}	2010-09

It's just as overpriced and poorly laid out and maybe a bit grimy, but carries less products to sift through when you just need to grab some simple things, hopefully not produce. Parking is easy and you can hit up the unpretentious Wine and Spirits in the same stop. I think this plaza still exists to prevent impoverished people from venturing into the other newer fancier stores which are a mere half mile away and designed to appeal to people who think they are cultured and discerning.	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

I still hold their teas in high regard. However, the food here sucks. They've always had a limited sandwich menu, but at some point even that has been reduced to three choices. I am a sucker for a good veggie sandwich, especially in combination with caffeine. Even though Enrico's is an easy walk from my home, I find myself either walking further or driving elsewhere for the caffeinated lunch experience. I guess they are trying to keep focus on the brews, but I don't think it's that hard to do both; I mean the staff seems highly competent, they have a kitchen and sandwiches are pretty simple recipes to follow and learn. With a new lunch joint in the 'hood (Park Bruges), why not expand lunch options rather than downgrade to the point of forfeiting without even the slightest struggle?	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

What's left is not a bad selection, but there are dramatically less choices, so it's no longer where I would go to sample new varieties of tea. Sandwich menu is even more severely limited and it seems that pretty much all the food is provided by U.S. Foods, or the like; nothing is local. It'd be way cool if they would source their pastries and bread locally. Until then, it is simply a great place to get coffee and espresso, with nice vibes and pleasant service.	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

It all starts with the parking experience, which is ridiculously horrible at this location - very poorly planned. And then, there's the prices - Giant Eagle being quite expensive compared to similar grocers in other cities, Whole Foods obviously has to get a one up on those; it's inherent in the scheme of selling premium ""natural"" goods. Whole Foods does have better lighting and layout than GE, and yes, a more discriminative selection of products, especially for people with specialized diets, like vegans (me) and gluten free adherents. The house baked bread here might be worse than GE (tough contest) - often under baked and thus soggy in middle and crusts tend to fall off; making gluten free-dom seem appealing.

I made a reservation for inside. They sat us outside. That turned out to be preferable to us because the tables that WERE available inside were very close to others. The patio was spacious and decorated with busts, slightly preferable to the inner cheap.trendy.interiors.com shit. Have you seen the terrible bathroom wallpaper borders? Probably not, as the ladies room is a very dim place; don't expect to be able to notice that your botox implant is crooked. Anyway, It was HOT under the Space-Ray heater on the patio, making for a sweaty and ice-instantly-melted beverage winter night. The food was alright with some interesting flavor pairings, but it was certainly not quite worth the price. The bread was the best I've had in Pittsburgh. Our server made it seem that everything she was doing was somebody else's job, in fact, it was mostly other people who delivered, which made it confusing in terms of knowing who to ask for things and whether or not to factor some of the fine service into the tip that presumably goes mostly to the primary server who was sub-par for upscale dining; our question for the kitchen left unanswered, ""the host is supposed to do that but I will..."" Run on. When I described the qualities I was looking for in my wine choice during beverage inquiry, she just stared blankly and waited for me to decide. The wine list did not include descriptions. The gal who delivered the wine thankfully did describe it before popping the top and it was determined that I did not want this cheapest option before me! She described another bubbly that sounded and was, according to my own tastes, delightful. 

I was so very satisfied with the sparkling sensation of the meal that I sought it out at the Wine and Spirits store. This was the moment that my minor disappointment in the value of my special-occasion dinner at Casbah turned into a feeling of devastating violation. I am talking about a 400% markup on the retail price of this wine. If you want to do your own math: at Casbah the 1/2 bottle of Gruet Blanc Du Noirs cost $35, while a WHOLE bottle at W&S is priced at $16.99. You can bet that I will choose to enjoy this wine elsewhere, like Avenue B (byob), next time. 

Casbah is lacking the quality service, honesty and original ambiance that should accompany creative food at moderately high prices.

**Update: I recently saw a full size bottle of the Gruet on a restaurant menu for $30; Casbah, take a tip!"	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 0}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

I will add that the food portions also seem to be decreasing! We went during happy hour last week and I had the worst tasting rye drink possible - described as rye with fig jam, bitters and lemon, sounded like something that cannot possibly be fucked up, but tasted like nothing but the juice wrenched out of unripe lemons - super dry and gave me a stomach ache. No fig flavor to be detected. To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a ""yes, it's got lemon in it."" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, ""yes, it's a lemon and fig drink."" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks. 

Also, their bar seating sucks. The chairs are stationary and far away from each other, and a bit far from the bar for a shorty like me; my feet don't reach the foot bar on the chair either, so my legs fall asleep trying to sit there."	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

Cash-only makes this even more difficult. Tofu wings appetizer was simply not very good; and I usually love these things! I tried the gyro wrap which was also a big disappointment. As far as I know, gyros are supposed to be pretty meaty, but this was mostly lettuce with sporadic chunks of seitan and cucumber,along  with dreaded diced unripe tomato. The wrap was dry and upon looking at the menu again, I see that the sauce that it probably requires costs an extra $.50. The tortilla itself was very white and seemingly unnatural compared to those found at most veggie establishments. My beverage was good and affordable--ginger lemonade. It was sweet for my tastes, but I am sure most people would have thought it perfect. I'll keep Quiet Storm in mind as a coffee shop, only.

F.Y.I after splitting the cost of the appetizer with a friend, my lunch cost me $17--ouch! I did have half of the wrap leftover and ate it later as a salad with my own dressing. It was quite good that way and I might recommend that QS rethink the Gyro presentation if they want to continue using so much lettuce."	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

The menu has slightly changed, and they are no longer cash only... This time it was the ""8th Ward"" that inflicted extreme disappointment. Not sure what 8th Ward is supposed to mean, but I will forever associate it with a dry boring place. And I thought we were getting a party platter! This appetizer sampler included THE WORST hummus evaar; I am near positive that they forgot to add garlic, lemon, salt and tahini to this chickpea paste that which was described as ""garlicky"" on the menu. Sooo wrong. ""The Butter,"" another WTF of a name, was also very dry and bland. The salsa was good! And there were plenty of dipping accessories, too many really, given the smallness of the unappetizing dip portions.

At this point, I've tried most of the vegan options QS has to offer and the only luck I've had has been with the B.Y.O.B. Go figure. 

I wouldn't care so much about how much of a tease this place is if I didn't REALLY desire a comfortable neighborhood place to eat comfortable food with a comfortable view of a cute waitress who writes fiction. And it frustrates me that few others seem to recognize the culinary (I shutter at even calling it that) mediocrity of ""the best"" vegetarian restaurant Pittsburgh has to offer."	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 1}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

I picked them because of the name, and on recommendation from a friend, AND the price of the exam was less than other places that I called (and I don't have insurance). I forgot her name now, but the optometrist was extremely nice and informative. I had a very slight sight deficiency and glasses were an option, but they were not pushed on me due to not *really* needing them. I wanted them anyway, especially because they had an awesome selection! Many of the frames are on the expensive side of the spectrum, but I found a cheaper pair that I LOVE. The gal that was there to assist in the transaction was really reassuring about it being the right pair - no up-sell.	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 1}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

I felt as though I could hear every movement of audience members and the sound of crunching popcorn made me laugh out loud for some reason, but the point is that I was distracted and did not at all feel immersed in the wonderful film in view.	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 4, u'cool': 1}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

I usually get either Baingan Bartha or Aloo Gobi, as well as a dal and a plain naan. The dals are confusing because there are three on the menu and they only really have two. I've tried to stop letting that perplex me, but I can never remember the one they don't have and often try to order it. Maybe my take out menu is outdated in that I should cross that one out. Ok, now on to important stuff...I order a spice level of 10 out of 10. The results are dynamite! Instead of using some cheap sauce or hot oil, I can see and taste that they use fresh chillies for added spice. They also use a ton of cilantro and delicious almost caramelized onions in the flavoring of the dishes. Each bite is a mouth explosion. And I love mouth explosions! 

This restaurant has it's shortcomings, but since it's the only place in town that has satisfied the lust of my taste buds for hot oral pleasure, I am a big fan."	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 1}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

The food did not taste fresh (I had pakoras and an eggplant dish) and the rice was definitely old and crisp from sitting in the bottom of the cooker. I asked for spicy and my dish was quite mild. We were there toward the end of the night and the staff seemed resentful of our presence. As much as I love Indian food, I'll probably give Taste of India one more chance sometime, earlier in the evening. I hope to report back with at least one additional star.	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

Now that they are back in action, the restaurant is better than ever! It is now fully handicapped accessible, with a bright clean new dining room and multiple bathroom stalls. I was worried that the prices may increase due to the remodel, but no, they are the same. The food, also same, if not improved. The Tom Kha soup is as awesome as can be and our entrees were perfectly delicious. They still feature a separate vegetarian menu to make ordering easy. Most anything on the vegetarian menu is or can be vegan (just ask about egg - veg items do not contain fish sauce or shrimp paste). And the service has always been excellent.	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 1}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

I test drove a Honda Element, which was clean and comfortable to drive, but the brakes on this one needed work - very slow response to stop. Then I looked at a Rav4. The first thing I noticed was dog hair on the interior surfaces. I'm surprised that seemingly simple things like brakes and cleanliness would not have been checked and fixed before putting the vehicles on the lot; my confidence was not inspired. I did like the drive course they used because it included big hills and bumps (sure, try to find a loop in PGH that doesn't!). And Paul was easy going and respectful of my search criteria.	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 1}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01
428	9SPwF-vRgtuHxciFxv5YLA	2012-12-18	tNAFMS5gr7ppZ4vciuH5lg	4	"I have dined at Soba more times than any other restaurant in Pittsburgh; it is my favorite! The dishes are original and creative, not like anything one can find elsewhere. I don't like tofu so much, but their tofu appetizer is fantastic - and is a large portion for a moderate cost. The chopped salad is worthy of my daily cravings. They usually have two vegetarian entrees, one or both of which can be made vegan. For a long while they had an awesome rice cake dish that I could not resist - it was a take on pesto with neato chewy rice cake noodle things and a seasonal mix of veggies and mushrooms. I do miss that one. But lately I've been getting the thakkali curry, which is pretty good too, with an interesting take on mango pickle (spicy!) and sadly, it comes with the best paratha in town. 

Once I had a bad experience with the rice cake dish - it came out all wrong. I was unable to complain at the table due to my company...but I emailed the manager because I wanted them to know that somebody in the kitchen didn't seem to be gettin' it. I also took that opportunity of contact to ask for a recipe for some to-die-for brussels sprouts they used to have on their sides menu that were no longer available. The response was above and beyond what I could have expected. Everything was made up for and then some. And they apparently didn't have the recipe I requested on record, but gave me a general run down of how to make it from memory; now I make them at home according to Soba's instructions every time!

The drinks! Excellent. Some of my favorites are The Metamorphosis (no longer on menu, but I think you can still get it), Offer You Can't Refuse, The Dirty Pickle, La Pinta and Beauty Mark...They also have a nice selection of Sake, which is rare in Pittsburgh, however is is expensive to buy here. 

The atmosphere is not really my style, but it passes as a cool calm romantic space. I do get sick of hearing the same music every time I go, but there are some great songs in the mix. The service is hit or miss, and some of the servers come off as scripted (probably new). Our last server was really slow about checking on us and drinks took a long time (though it wasn't busy). And as with most Big Burrito restaurants, I don't like that there are separate food runners from servers, because it makes it confusing and more time consuming to ask for things. I prefer the bar seating and service, usually. 

All in all, I think Soba is Pittsburgh's best place to eat and drink."	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 0}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

I have been to Richard at Dean of Shadyside twice for cuts.  I am the sort who sits down and says, ""I don't care what you do, just give me a great haircut."" Before cutting, Richard administers a sort-of consultation during which you have the chance to express your preferences until he gets a wild look in his eyes, indicating he has decided what he is going to do and seductively explains it in such a way that you can't refuse. He has a wildly ambitious passion that will make you wonder about taking him to bed, though no doubt about it, it's going to be all about him.

The first cut was probably the best I've ever had. It was the sort of style that warranted countless compliments from friends and strangers alike.

My most recent cut included a lap dance to the entirety of Estefan's ""Turn the Beat Around."" Inviting eye contact, check. Suggestive pelvic motions, oh yes. Risky jump onto rotating chair, tip increase. Flips of the hair (mine), obviously. Clipping all the while! What more could I have asked for other than for him to ""take it all off!?"" Luckily, I maintained composure and did walk out with a decent mid-length haircut. 

So, between the two experiences, I do feel that I got great bangs for my bucks. Bangs on my head, expert blow jobs and a comic fantasy for a fuck. 

My only real issue with this salon is the atmosphere. It has about as much character as Super Cuts and operates like a busy factory, each master stylist having his own minions to order about. The music, though occasionally a turn on for the stylists, is generally bad."	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 8, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 2}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

And then when I finally find that one item that I desperately wanted enough to look for it here, I face the crazy check out lines where one has plenty of time to analyze a disturbing cross-section of consumer society, at which point I often re-think my desire for the superfluous item in hand, set it down and swear to never return to this store again."	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 0}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

Super convenient and waaay more pleasant than the East Liberty Post Office.  I often leave with a feeling of nostalgia for old fashioned family business', something I'll never get from the kids at the FedEx counter. Even so, I wouldn't go out of my way to spend extra to ship from A & A, but it's great when you're in the neighborhood and/or need to ship from multiple carriers. And it's usually a quick stop.

I avoided this place for awhile because of its generic sounding name. Once I saw the extensive menu, with vast vegetarian selections, I realized that there is hope for a vegetarian in need of a quick fix. And I have found the food to be well above average American-Chinese takeout . 

I really like the chewy consistency of their soy protein. I am a fan of chewy...I know it's not for everybody. 

They do have brown rice! At least, they do now, and it's mighty good. A little chewy, too. 

Last night, I tried the ""Sizzling Sensation"" wheat gluten (mock beef). The sauce was not as spicy or peppery as I would have liked, but it was flavorful and the texture of the gluten was pleasantly soft and chewy (not as hard as the soy protein, though my dining companion who is not a fan of the chewy likened it to gristle). I also had the broccoli with garlic sauce, which is the dish I usually count on in Chinese fare, and it was a delicious compliment to the other dish. Unlike the broccoli and garlic sauce of most places, the broccoli was not swimming in goop and it actually tasted garlicky and even tangy. The broccoli was crisp and fresh. The meal was entirely satisfying and I will order both of these dishes again. 

Speaking of dishes, one entree that I can warn against is the ""Taro Bowl A-La-King."" Looks and tastes as if cooked in dish water... 

If you do not like greasy food, order from the selection of steamed dishes, or ""weight watchers"" items. That goes for just about anywhere! 

Delivery from China Palace has been quick in my experience, almost unbelievably so! In-house service is also quick and notably friendly."	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 0}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

Historically, Brewers' was dedicated to supporting people with AIDS and they continue to subtly promote prevention of HIV/AIDS. There is absolutely nothing obnoxious or outrageous about this gay bar; it's just a super chill place to enjoy a drink, smoke and/or video game (on one of those crappy bar consoles). On Tuesdays they have free pool and $3 pitchers. Our draft Straubs on a normal night were $1.75 each. Expect drunken characters and adequate, if not friendly, service. Predominantly older male crowd, but a welcoming/indifferent one. If you are feeling generous and quirky, bring along pig paraphernalia to leave behind for the barkeeper.	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 3}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

436	cMye2oCRy1qAvwMK-7i6JA	2014-06-13	UjhnGotVeupe8a31fg5H_Q	4	This is a perfect sized music venue, in my opinion. I'd rather drown in the sweat of a small crowd than be lost in a sea of people, or worse yet, swimming in a large open space with small schools of humans lingering in separate pools. Here, no matter how many people show up, the energy of the show is palpable and contained. The sound has been nearly great, in my experiences, which puts Club Cafe well above and beyond most other venues (insert more water metaphors here). I think Club Cafe looks really cool from the outside but doesn't feel too cool (ie. pretentious) inside and actually lacks character, making it a nice neutral space to suit any genre. But it's pretty rare for them to book shows that are of interest to me, so I don't necessarily follow or monitor their schedule. Service is efficient, but sometimes the drinks are weak, and I really hate going to the Southside.	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 1}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

It's worth it just to experience the novel concept of eating potluck style fare in a vintage shop. But when it comes down to it, Zenith's execution is very simple. The brunch buffet (only available on Sundays) is all vegan and exciting, but the food isn't really all that much fun. The cakes and pies are truly bad and the salads are average. When I say ""potluck style,"" I mean that this is the sort of food your plebeian friends or family prepare for parties - cheap and easy to make. The entrees are typically extremely uninspired, bland and obviously mass produced and re-heated as necessary. I would never even think of coming here on any day but Sunday (ok, well, I did once go on a Thursday; we were the only ones there and it sucked). I would give Zenith two stars, but I have to give them a little extra credit for business design - convincing people to crowd in one day of the week so as to require a wait during which people can shop deliriously (hungover and on an empty stomach) before eating. What they do the rest of the week is beyond me, it's definitely not creative menu design - I guess they are probably religiously hawking thrift store goods to re-sell..."	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01
438	3KCL_Bu8mOk-h7Bp-IXL8Q	2012-06-28	64oB4jwWPujRs7KSsnBk_g	3	"A city restaurant without a website - how quaint! I don't think I would have ever discovered it without Yelp. I first sought it out based on reviews a few years ago and I remember thoroughly enjoying a salad on the patio on a fine summer's day. Then, earlier this spring my partner and I stopped by to read the menu - my partner noted the sorta high prices and I noted the total lack of vegan options. Someone from inside popped out to let us know that they weren't yet open for dinner (it was b/w lunch and dinner time) and asked if we'd like to make a reservation for later, all in a very kind and inviting manner. I mentioned that I was hoping to find something vegan and she assured me that the chef could make something. We passed that time (due to cheap partner), but I knew I would return for some al fresco joy, and earlier this week, I did. I called ahead to make a reservation and to make sure they were really ok with making a vegan entree. When we arrived, the vegan thing was acknowledged by our server and we were seated in the best spot on the patio, next to the cute and oddly gregarious turtles! We were handed some well used paper menus and our cheap sparkling wines were properly chilled/corked/stored. From then on, things got awkward. My dining companion, who kept baby talking to the turtles throughout the meal and even feeding them, coerced me into drinking her recently deceased grandmother's favorite cheap sparkling wine (Asti) and we made a toast to this woman I never had the pleasure of meeting. And we were left with crusty menus that which had no apparent vegan selections and waited for the server to, um, maybe, uh mention what they could do. Instead she came to take our order. And I had to explain that since nothing is really vegan on the menu, I needed her to describe what could be made vegan. Uhhhh, the mushroom consomme annnnd a salad...ummm...let me go ask the chef. The chef had an excellent answer, it is a mystery to me as to why he was not consulted earlier. I did try the mushroom consomme to start, which was alright (I would not order it again), and ordered the chef's special with was described as a zucchini stuffed with spiced cous cous. Sounded boring. But as presented, it had a lot going on, I almost feared it had too much going on - tomato sauce, capers, walnuts, basil, golden raisins, cinnamon, bread crumbs...whoa! Was it going to be as clumsy as our service? No! It was well composed and very satisfying to my palate which was maybe only slightly deteriorated from drinking Asti. The chef also sent out some complimentary small bites before our entrees, I imagine because the special dish was expected to take longer than a usual menu item, though it didn't seem like an especially long wait. Awesome gesture, as it proved someone was on their toes. At the end of the meal we had our second most painful conversation with the server, regarding coffee. It should have been a pretty simple exchange, really. I ordered espresso and my friend asked if the coffee was french pressed. Instead of just saying ""no,"" we got some bumbling convoluted answer that left us confused - I was able to gather that no, it was not french press coffee and that either the coffee or espresso (or both?) were from some sort of pod - like maybe a machine that sort of presses a pod...My friend, bewildered, just ordered an espresso, but I had to ask, soooo is the espresso from a pod thingy? Yep...ok, I am sorry but I don't want the espresso, and I joked about drawing the line at imitation ""champagne."" No fun. I tried to be really kind and easy going to make up for being such a damn snob, an inconvenience at every turn, for trying to understand what was being offered. As I watched our server describe the specials to an arriving table, counting the two of them on her fingers as if she was twisting each special off of a finger and squeezing it into her palm, I felt sorry for those others who came to endure her writhing translations. As much as I appreciated my special dish, and service aside, I probably would not put them through the trouble of having me dine again. I don't believe the menu changes very often, definitely not every day as the name suggests, as it didn't seem particularly seasonal (for example, one of their two desserts featured pumpkin which, even though it's none of my business, I thought was weird for late June), nor much, if at all, different from my previous visits, and certainly not freshly printed. 

Nonplussed?
+ Cash only (+ as in bring it) 
+ Very pleasant patio for those rare perfect days
+ ^ With friendly turtles, until turtle soup season (maybe next year)
+ BYOB
+ Capable and accommodating kitchen to make up for non-communicative server
= Worth trying, especially if you don't have dietary restrictions, you have expendable cash, it's a nice day to spend with turtles and you want to provide your own Asti.

Hrm, the nonplussed point system might be my new method of expressing cynical optimism."	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 3, u'useful': 4, u'cool': 2}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

Love their hummus but I'm not so crazy about their baba ghanooj which is weird for me because I usually love baba and hate hummus; thanks for messing with my brain Ali Baba! The fatoosh is usually amazing (though there have been a few inconsistencies in quality) and the mujaddara is quite good. The falafil and stuffed grape leaves are skippable here as far as I am concerned. The pita is fantastic, and they give you tons of it with to-go orders or delivery, big plus! When dining in, I always truly appreciate the pleasant design of the restaurant, although it's a bit run-down and dated (dated 1982, actually). The best thing about Ali Baba, is the font used for the restaurant name; it adds to the character and appeal in a way that I feel unable to explain.	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 1}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

444	cjD2yGRhT5yaSj_KP55Ptw	2009-06-19	6oPGsjDm-blkmnWmG-LO4Q	3	"I recently went to Kaya's monthly vegetarian prix fix dinner, complete with wine pairings. I ordered all of the vegan options. I was not entirely impressed...

The amuse, a beet ceviche, was delicious -- I would have traded out my main course for a big bowl of it. The two bite portion was a true tease.

Course one was roasted potatoes, meh. These were served with a green tomato ketchup which tasted too much like heinz for me to give a shit. OK, it did have notes of apple which was slightly interesting. But also served on the side was a ""sour cream"" and onion dip that was pretty yummy and had hints of horseradish.  I think the ""sour cream"" base is the same as that used at Mad Mex.

Second course was Chilled English Pea Soup. I LOVE raw english peas, thus appreciated the imagination of this soup (I believe it was a raw dish). However, I would have just as soon cracked open fresh pods, enjoying the full texture of nature's candy. Toward the bottom of my bowl of soup, I realized that blenderization diminishes the essence of peas, and felt slightly sad.

Carrot-lime intermezzo -- fine.

Third course was a big disappointment. Roasted Porchini Arepas sounded exciting (""what are arepas?""), but it tasted rather plain. The arepa was dry; dying for some of that ""sour cream"" and onion condiment from course one. The mushrooms were delicious, as mushrooms are, and that is my only compliment for this course. Crispy sweet potato fries were served on the side, but again with no condiments and I had had my fill of potatoes at course one. This course lacked moisture and flavor all around.

So why three stars instead of two? Dessert was amazing. ""Strawberry Pound Cake"" is the strawberry short-cake I have been dreaming about for 13 years (about the length of time I have been vegan). Probably not all that difficult to make, but wow, those strawberries were good (I surmise they were local, yay)!

The mignardises, chili chocolate, was like a slightly spicy m&m. Cute.

To quote Kaya's website, ""The menus emphasize flavor and variety, presenting familiar foods in exciting ways, and making exotic foods delightfully accessible."" I feel that exotic foods were completely lacking from this meal and that the emphasis was placed on creativity with familiar foods. Plantains would have been an excellent substitution for one of the potato dishes. The meal was full of ""American"" flavor with very little suggestion of ""island"" influence (ie. lime and cilantro). Perhaps they strive to use local ingredients, which would be cool, but there were no indications of that on the menu. No, I am not going to lay into a discourse to define ""American"" cusine, but hey, the restaurant is located in the U.S., admittedly serves ""fusion"" styles and the kitchen boys were white; probably studied culinary arts in 'merica. I mean that one should not expect an exotic experience at Kaya, though one should expect, demand even, an imaginative and quality meal.

The wine pairings were all perfectly on point; I owe much to this in creating what was generally a lovely meal. 

The service was also excellent. We had come in from the rain and were soaked; the host brought us towels to dry ourselves. Our server made intense eye contact which, in my eyes, made her an attentive communicator.

The ambiance was nice, with exception for the tv airing CNN in the front corner; it wasn't obtrusive, but it was there. I did not care for the seating. The tables were close together, and there was a great distance across the table between my date and I, thus at Kaya, you will often be sitting closer to your neighbor than your companion. 

Thankful to the date who paid,
Heidi"	review	4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.3	{u'funny': 13, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 38, u'writer': 15, u'list': 3, u'note': 34, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 28, u'more': 4, u'cool': 34}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	11	[0TQZTnvoG5iBZv1rS2rciw, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, DSWiwtUyWK1YwY8NBKDhGg, jwKgiDjVEC8DPjG5NTGllg, dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA, DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, VEj6Mr70JTOPwCb-GCzytg, Ai1t-UCf0ElszaDajWlnwg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w, fPrTgq_JW1jAr79MDoJV8g, YCESYzOvZz5Cc5VnDAGAJw, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A, HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg, L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg, -u91UNssob3wy6rTu7CYxg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, EYAqA1-Q6kS-J9T8TyYiww, -0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA, dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g, qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, 7DsXHUk2MqXLfXPxznbuQA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA, mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw, cNsuaATGLVUUpDSkChEk-g, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ, uM_agwHRDBtZ093U-qDjCw, ZqSRTwvHRGVLjXMV3GX3qg, UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 2PL5lNgz81FMWvsfezGBcg, qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ, PDKYLQMrt2hjkI-sdsnw6A, mIXjfrP-DkLvw0USMOllbQ, s_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw, g23fX1wynH2Ar5VAfGrwLA, JF5ZNQuLw6iQ_CNQZhqODA]	Heidi	188	user	{u'funny': 204, u'useful': 452, u'cool': 214}	2009-01

We were there pre-dinner rush, thus it was not busy, yet we waited an abnormally long time to order. Good trick, because in the meantime we decided to need an appetizer. Once our server acknowledged us, he seemed rushed and hastily answered our questions; yes, the annoying vegan oriented questions. 

Our spring rolls were airy and flavorless :(.

The main dish, a mango veggie curry was so-so. We ordered it with tofu, but did not get any. The sauce was watery, though did have a nice flavor. The mangoes--ripe and delicious. The portion was tiny! And at $15, I find that to be inexcusable. There was not even enough rice to fill up on. Granted, we were two people sharing one dish, but we usually have no problems, due to the American sized portions we have come to expect. Bottom line is that the value did not match the price. For $7, this would be a three star review.

Our server resolved to be friendly around check time.

Why two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I'll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it.

He told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.

Here's where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.

So our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.

A month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. 

I completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they're waiting for the permit, but they'll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.

Finally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they're digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn't informed! 

I was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said ""there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow."" Well, that didn't happen.

Then two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. 

Finally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn't happen here.

My main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It's not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.

Even though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!), I would not recommend them to anyone."	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 10, u'cool': 1}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

There's rows and rows of baskets and bedazzling jewels and paper and...oh my...scrap booking!  When I want to find boring old felt....it's like...where do I start?  

I'm in a hurry, as always, and I rush in and the first thing I look for is an employee.  No one to be found.  I could call out and my voice would come echoing back.  I run between rows of paper, wood and gosh darn scrap booking....no felt!  Where do I find felt!  Where do I find an employee!?

FINALLY, I find one after 15 minutes of wondering around.  She's incredibly nice and leads me to the felt.  This is not the first time I've been hard up to find help.  I tell her she was hard to find, and she tells me that they're ""low on payroll"" and can't have any one the floor BUT HER!  In that WHOLE store, JUST HER!  That's ridic!

Not a month ago I was, again, in a slight hurry and stood in line for about 15 minutes to check out, with 2 employees at the register and 6 people per line, I gave up and walked out.

I WISH I could play a song at the drop of a hat. Too bad I never took piano lessons and I'd probably end up mumbling half the lyrics other than the chorus. Unless it's Salt n' Pepa's Shoop. 

This is a really great place to go when you have out of town guests or are looking for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out. It's just something different to do other than boozing it up at the bars on a Saturday night. 

Keep in mind you'll be paying around a $5-10 cover plus whatever drinks and food you get. The good thing is the food is coming from the attached Rock Bottom Brewery. So a lot of it is restaurant quality good. Plus the brewery beer is actually pretty good! OF course you will be paying restaurant price drinks...so of course they're up charged a bit. But you do pay for the whole experience....so you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits! 

The guys who play are incredibly talented. There's 2 guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano. They pretty much play ANYTHING you ask. Contemporary songs, throw back songs, fight songs, rap songs, pop songs. You name it, they play it. 

My favorite part is when they switch out to another two guys. They'll all four get on stage and play two piano's, a guitar and drums. They usually rock out with some fun familiar songs (um, Journey, of course!). 

The birthday song is seriously the best. They sing to you....and call you some names....with expletives. But in a totally nice way of course. You just have to go!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 1}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

Some have been really great...Jim Breuer. Some have been (surprisingly) very bad....Tracy Morgan. But it's always been a pleasant experience at the venue.  There's not a bad seat in the house and it's small enough that you get to see and hear everything from the stage.  Beware if you sit in the very front, you KNOW what's going to happen!

A couple downsides.... 

Waiting outside in a line in the dead of winter.  The lobby is so small you're forced to wait outside until the first show starts or the first show let's out.  And if you want a good seat, you may be waiting in line for a while.  BURR!

The two drink minimum. I kinda get why they do it, to make money, of course. But this means they jack up the prices of watered down drinks. Better to stick with beer and wine at these places. No frou frou drinks for me! 

Also, as to be expected, the food's not that great. In a perfect foodie world, places that served food would make it fantastic! Since that's not going to happen, you just go into those places hoping for the best. I've never had anything great here. Nacho platter too many re fried beans, to little nacho's....annnnnd I'm out!

I really don't~  I should have seen this coming.  There were telltale signs of this happening. First, they switched the pharmacy to the other end of the store where the now defunct Iggle video was. That's A-ok with me, I didn't use the pharmacy anyway. 

But THEN, THEN they moved the whole toiletries section over there. They put my spaghetti and ""ethnic food"" section (by the way, I love that ethnic food includes spaghetti) to where my Tylenol was. My kitty food is now where my spaghetti once was. Can you tell how exasperated I'm getting?? 

Did I mention I don't mind change? But here's the thing, I really hate grocery shopping. It's kinda sorta my own fault because I must read every label to make sure I'm not eating something with 25 grams of fat and 5000 calories (even though ice cream may go into my cart from time to time.) So going to this Giant Eagle frequently was nice because I KNEW WERE EVERYTHING WAS. Now I don't....wahhh! 

Ok, I'll stop crying. I know I'll eventually be back. I'm sure (??) it will be an even better more magical grocery shopping experience once they're done. But I can't take it for right now. I'll be forced to shop at the Ghetto Bird down in the Southside until my former #1 store is all shiny and new again."	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

Let's do the compliment sandwich.  Positive - negative - positive!  

The negative... I feel like Sandcastle is the forgotten redheaded stepchild of Kennywood.  They keep pouring money into K-wood, but Sandcastle stays the same year after year.  Now, granted I haven't been there in YEARS, but everything seemed the same as I left it other than one new slide.  I haven't been there in about 9 years.  One new slide in 9 years?  Hmmmmm....

I see major places to improve.  Especially the pool.  I honestly think the slides are great, although you could always add more, they're still fun.  The pool... it's just packed.  So packed that you'd think they'd add a second pool.  Looking around it looks like they have the extra space.  Maybe an adults only pool?  Swimming with 20 zillion kids, plus adults drinking (yes I like that you can bring your bevvie in the pool... but it's kinda weird being around so many kids) and you start to wonder how clean the water is.  I mean, 20 zillion kids you gotta expect a good amount of kiddos are peeing in the pool!  

The sidewalks are also scalding hot.  I'd assume since many of the people are walking around barefoot you'd be able to custom order some kind of non sun absorbing surface.  And I""m NOT investing in those dorky water shoes, sorry!  

I'm ALWAYS happy to see a Potato Patch stand!  Just as good as K-wood!  They also serve chicken tender, which is nice if you want a little meat to add on.  Nothing more is needed for me!  Although the frozen drinks looked tasty and tempting, it was so hot out I was just downing water by the gallons.  You're also allowed to bring in your own snacks and food, which I think is nice for families who want to save a little mola.  

Again, Sandcastle is so awesome to have in the Burgh, it would be nice to see improvements.  It always seems packed in the summer months, so why not keep on improving it?  Or maybe they think don't fix what's not broken.

I will state, as I always do in these types of situations, that I have worked many years in retail. I know what you're supposed to do. I know the ways I've displayed exemplary service and I know the ways I've slacked off. I get it, I really do.

So I'm in the store early. Hardly any people in there. Weird for the Semi-Annual Sale time of year. Usually it doesn't matter what time you're there during the sale, it's always busy. 

I went through my usual bins and picked up a mess of undies and bras. Since no one was at the check out counter and I needed a spot to go through things, I set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick. I actually always like to do this, just to shoot the breeze, but also to get their opinions on items I'm buying. 

The girl behind the counter was having non of this though.I asked her about a bra and she said she didn't know about that one, but said it should work. I understand, you can't try them all. But the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter. I even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me. Ghost town. Tumbleweed rolled by. No one.

So I'm going through my stuff and separating what I want and don't want and she's sighing and grabbing things saying ""Soooo, you DON'T want these???"" Um, I'm not asking you to help me sort things. I'm not holding up a line. I'm just trying to not spend $$$ on an accidental XS pair of undies that got mixed in! 

After that, it's not exactly what she said, but how she acted. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before. I ended up grabbing my discards and putting them back myself (which I really don't mind doing, but after she huffed and puffed, I didn't even want to deal with her). 

The thing is, I was nice the entire time. I don't expect you to sit there and be sugary sweet either. Just do what you were hired to do. Be nice and sell some bras. If you come to work in a bad mood, the real world is not going to give you a hug. Suck it up and do your job or work where you don't have to talk to anyone else ever."	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 9, u'cool': 4}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01
458	VkFDer80GOrelWALdgNReg	2011-01-17	P5ydJhKAjhhNYDl9yTBMLg	5	"I'm a crazy cat lady and proud of it! 

Being a volunteer here has been so fulfilling on many different levels.  It has made me feel so good to be able to help out with something that I feel passionately about.  You can tell that the staff puts a lot of effort into taking care of these animals they accept in.  A lot of times people will say, oh I can't do it, it's too sad.  But the thing is, it's not.  It's actually so great because these animals come here and find loving homes instead of being on the street or in an environment that's toxic.  I rarely see animals there for a long time.  I think that's a testament to the way they are treated while they're in the facility. 

Now I'll admit, I'm not the biggest dog fan, so I help out in the cat shelter.  I can talk about that with a lot more knowledge than the dog side.  They just built a new cat facility on their property so they have their own shelter.  The cats are all set up in a huge room.  They have two rooms for people to play with the cats when they are looking to adopt them.  These rooms are also used for ""cat cuddling.""  That's what I do when I volunteer.  I get to take the cats out so that they can play, be cuddled or just run around.  Then the cats are able to get out of the cages and get used to human contact. 

The other great thing about the ARL is that they have foster parents who take in cats and dogs while they're waiting to be adopted.  This way, they get a great home environment and it relieves the facility of having too many animals at one time. At different points in the year the adoption rates are different depending on the amount of animals they have.  Cat rates are usually cheaper in the Spring/Summer because there's more coming in and dog rates are cheap in the late summer months.  The added bonus of adopting a pet from the ARL is that they are spade or neutered when you adopt them.  It's actually cheaper then taking them to a normal vet on your own. 

I would STRONGLY recommend coming here to check out the animals and hopefully find your next furry friend!  OR you can volunteer!  They have volunteer informational sessions the first Saturday of every month.  After that you only have one training session to complete and you're ready to volunteer!  

Just check it out if you're curious.  You won't regret it!  Your new furry friends will appreciate it as well!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 3, u'useful': 11, u'cool': 5}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

I sat amongst the gathered hipsters, moms, friends, ladies who lunch, power business lunch people in a sunny little corner of the room sipping my delicious Indian Spice black tea.

Service was very friendly and looking at the fresh pastries and lunch list of homemade soups and sandwiches made me want to come back and enjoy a leisurely afternoon or perhaps work day here taking in all they have to offer.  

I was surprised when I asked to see the tea list and the barista told me they didn't have much to offer.  Still looked like a good amount to me and I was pleased to see a variety of different offerings some coffee shops don't offer (because, well, they're usually coffee focused!).

I attended an event here for the first time and was amazed by what good shape the theater was in. I loved the bright red chairs and classic feel. Mind you, I really know nothing of what this theater used to be used for... Although I can imagine very glamorous old movies like Singin' In The Rain (maybe this movie was not so much glamorous, but the namesake says as much). 

I was surprised by how comfortable it was. The seats are comfy and the leg room is decent. I can imagine by looking around that most seats are decent for viewing a show. They do offer many different events here throughout the year, which is great because it would be a sad fact if this theater wasn't used.

I honestly want to look for things put on here now because I like the theater so much.

I've been interested in a bunch of the nights they've hosted before, but have never made way way over. I went to celebrate one Miss Aja J's birthday for Hip Hop vs House night. I'm a big hip hop fan, but not much into house. They had two dueling DJ's and an MC hosting the event. I actually liked the mash up of the two genre's. It was definitely better than just house.

They have about 5 beers on tap, which I think is impressive for a ""club."" Especially different since it was much more than Miller Light. They actually had a Pumpkin brew on tap, which forgive me for not remember, I was into! At $5.50 it wasn't breaking the bank, but it wasn't a $3 Miller Light fo sho! 

We came a little early, but it seemed like the night really started to pick up around 11pm. Yep, I'm old, I left at 11pm. Lame, I know!

The place is always packed and you're usually left bumping into people left and right.  You may even get a nasty look, yikes!  The parking is atrocious, with only probably only 75 spots for a pretty popular store.  And have fun just getting into the parking lot from Centre.  Okay, I'm going to a negative place right now....

I stop in here one a whim when I'm out in the area if I'm really craving sushi, because it's way better than the Giant Eagle's sushi down the street.  It's still not he best fast sushi (Giant Eagle Waterfront), but it does the job.  Again, they're almost $3 more than at GE.  When I run in to grab sushi and usually ad Odwalla by bill comes to almost $20!  I'd rather eat a fast meal at Qdoba...sorry...I said it!

So that unique wedding venue... it is here! Who wouldn't want to party among Bourbon Street in the comfort of East Liberty? 

Holds up to 150 and around 90 seated. Only drawbacks are you must use valet, as there's really no parking around the area. You aren't able to bring in your own catering, but you can use one of five companies they suggest. Which is honestly better than only having one to choose from.

The restaurant is really cool looking but I was a little confused by the bar set up.  We sat at the bar because they didn't have any tables open.  I usually don't mind sitting at the bar but the stools are bolted to the floor, and about 2 feet from each other.  If you have three people with you, forget about mingling!  

Also, the service was very iffy.  There was a bartender, and then a server for the bar area (or what it seemed like).  The bartender got us our drinks, but never told us a server would be with us.  I figured she was our server too.  But then some other woman came up to us all flustered.  She never introduced herself, just asked what we wanted and kept saying ""okay, okay, okay.""  Just very odd.  It continued that way the entire time.

I tried the prix fixed brunch for $24, which includes your choice of an alcoholic bevvie (Bloody Mary, Sangria or Mimosa), appetizer and main course.  I had the mimosa, that was the perfect mix (splash of OJ:), Polenta and Eggs Beni.  The cinnamon polenta, which was delish: light, fluffy and warm with dried fruit and almonds on top.  I loved it!

The Eggs Beni with smoked salmon.  It was just okay.  I kept trying to think pf what was missing and I believe it was that the hollandaise sauce had no real taste.  I expect hollandaise sauce to be rich and creamy, this was thin and blah.  

I definitely want to go back and try the dinner, see if maybe I'll have a little better luck.  So kick it up a notch Casbah, you've been around for a while, but I still expect good food!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 8, u'cool': 2}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01
465	2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A	2015-03-18	iIHtzyvfojXHf2Iz7mEeQg	4	"It is DUE time to update this review. Why? Because I had a phenomenal brunch here, and it totally restored my faith in not only Casbah, but Big Burrito. I can't lie, I love what the Big Burrito group does. I think all their restaurants are awesome, but Casbah was always my least favorite. Now, I feel it is on par with the others!

I love a good prix fixe brunch, and for $28 you receive a cocktail, appetizer and entree. So I started off with a mimosa (always a good start!). Then I ordered the Tomato & Basil Bisque and parmesan crostini, which was excellent. I'm very judgmental of tomato bisque, as it is one of my favorite soups. 

Then came the main course. Braised Lamb & Eggs: braised Elysian Fields Farm lamb shoulder, spinach, poached local eggs, tarragon, grilled sourdough. I love lamb so hard. It's by far my favorite meat, but it has to be cooked with care. This definitely had flavor, was tender and paired perfectly with the spinach and eggs. 

I couldn't finish my meal, so they boxed it up. I separated the sourdough and the rest of the dish so the bread wouldn't get soggy, and our server gave it to me without the sourdough. I mentioned I did that on purpose and he immediately went back into the kitchen and got me fresh bread. How nice is that?

For some weird reason, I had in my head that they made these awesome smoothies. Well... they do not. But they make milkshakes. Any other day I would have totes been into the shake but...

I reeeeeally wanted a smoothie, so I opted out of the milkshake (I know, a rare occasion), and went with a iced chai. I love that they make their own mix of chai and they also don't sweeten it, so you can sweeten it yourself. Super sweet chai is super gross. Just sayin'. 

I also ordered the Sesame Noodle Platter (noodles, soy, tofu, red cabbage, mushrooms, broccoli, onions, peppers) with a ginger carrot salad. It was a solid meal. I mean, it wasn't necessarily a platter (I think a variety of separate items), but a noodle dish. I liked that there was a decent amount of veggies and not just a few, with a massive amount of noodles. I hate when that happens! It was also lightly sauced, not too heavy and sticky. Plus the fried tofu was awesome! Honestly, I've never had such good tofu before. I rarely get it because I think tofu can be so bland, but this was bomb! 

A nice plus is it's a great environment to eat and work. Free WiFi and nice big tables to work on.

I had high hopes, especially with how much I loved the ambiance. I love tomato bisque, so I was excited to dive into that for a first course, but it was very strangely thin. When you imagine bisque, you imagine heavy cream used, but I believe it was broth based. I just wasn't digging it. 

But then our starter came out, a goat cheese-stuffed puff pastry, and it was divine! Things were looking up! It was a delicious mix of cheese, plus light and airy puff pastry that we gobbled up. 

Me and a friend split two main courses; the Butternut Squash Ravioli with Pumpkin Coulis and the lamb burger with fontina and caramelized onions. I love lamb and I love squash, so this was the perfect splitting combo. I was pretty bummed when the lamb burger, while good lamb, didn't give off a lot of flavor. Which was surprising considering it also had caramelized onions, which usually pack a flavorful punch. The butternut squash ravioli also didn't offer the flavors imagines. Mostly it was the sauce that seemed to fall flat with this dish. 

There was a sweet ending my friends, this cute little mason jar filled with layers of fresh raspberries, cream and Portuguese cookies was an amazing finish. I only wish everything had been equally as amazing.

I still feel like I'm not done with Cafe Zinho, so hopefully the next visit will be all wines, er wins!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 6, u'cool': 4}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

My friend and I were driving through Homestead past Nancy B's Bakery when she said ""You know Page Diary Mart makes an ice cream sundae with her homemade chocolate chip cookies?""  No more words needed to be said between us.  The decision was silently made that we'd head down Carson Street and there as no stopping us!

The only child in me wanted to order the entire chocolate chip cookie sundae for myself.  The calorie counting adult in me knew the right decision would be to split it.  I mean, let's get real... this thing is monster size!  You can easily split it BUT... I could EASILY gobble that whole thing down in one sitting!  

It was amazing!  We watched them heat up the cookies and toss them into the soft serve vanilla ice cream that melted it just enough that it mixed in perfectly with the warm chocolate chip cookie.  Add hot fudge and it was ice cream overload to the max.  But in the best way possible.

FACT: I ate so much I thought they would have to wheel me out on a stretcher.
FACT: It's a serious hidden gem in a slightly sketchy neighborhood.

Need some more info, because I'm comin' atcha with the goods! To start they set the table with ""Holy Oil,"" which is banana pepper olive oil for dipping Italian bread in, a seasoned cecci bean and cheese gustoso and a goat cheese and olive spread. I wish they sold that banana pepper olive oil because I wanted to have it every day of my life! 

We ordered the famous Meatball appetizer. This meatball is for serious! It's massive and stuffed with mozzarella cheese. Yep, I'm for realz. It was just oozing Italian sexiness, in a ball. As soon as I tasted the red sauce, it tasted like my Grandma's, which sparked fond memories and made me want to actually live in this place. 

We also ordered the Trifolata, which is assorted mushrooms and currants in marsala cream. It was also incredible. The bad/good of it was that it wasn't really needed because they give you so much food, but it was delicious, so whatever!

For the Third course they serve you your choice of pasta either with their famous home made vodka sauce or fettucini. But here's the thing, the fettucini is made in front of you... in a cheese wheel. Yep, I'm for realz again! I know I'm crazy for not ordering it, but I really love me some vodka sauce and was incredibly happy with this amazing homemade sauce. My hubby got the fetticini and loved it. See, we're all happy here!

Fourth course is a salad with red vinagariette, roasted red peppers, candied walnuts, golden raisens and gargonzola cheese. It wasn't memorable amongst all the bangin' dishes but not too shabby at all.

For the Fifth course (and when I finally tapped out) I ordered the Cioppino with shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops and fish in a saffron and tomato broth with sambuca. It matched all the other dishes. Just incredible. Loved the broth, loved the succulent scallop (just one, but I can't complain, I was stuffed by that point!), the shrimp was jumbo and the fish was perfectly cooked. And the garlic bread was excellent.

Whenever anyone says things are expensive, I usually think they're talking $30 a plate. But, this place is legit expensive. Think $50 (ish) a plate. But what I can tell you is it was 100% worth it! We had leftovers for two days! Talk about an Italian hospitality. Which, by the way, the service was exceptional, but I would have expected that here. 

A perfect special night out, if you don't mind unbuckling a couple notches in front of your dining companion, of course!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 5, u'useful': 17, u'cool': 5}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

Beer on tap are mixed between the regulars: Yuengling, Mad Hat, Guiness and lots of seasonal and rotating beers.  I love a place with a good draft offering.  I'm way more into a draft than a bottle.  Don't ask me why...maybe because the gulps can be bigger:)

Goulash in the Contrucci household was made of elbow noodles, beef and spaghetti sauce.  I guess you can't believe everything your parents tell you right?  

So going in here, I was thinking, great...mom's goulash!  What was set in front me looked NOTHING like what I was used to.  It was a mish mosh of veggies,noodles, gravy and some random unidentifiable food items.  I usually eat whatever is put in front of me, so I wasn't scared to dive it.  Sadly, I just didn't like it.  I thought it was actually not very appetizing at all.  I know, I know, this is like ""world famous"" goulash, but I was NOT into it!  

What I was into was the German Potato Salad.  I love it, and honestly, I feel like I never get the same version of it anywhere in the Burgh.  This was a no frills version, with scallop sliced potatoes and a thick vinegar sauce.  Maybe a bit too much, but not enough for me to eat it all!  

Would I go back? If someone else really wanted to go there, but I wouldn't suggest it nor would I go on my own.

I really had no clue what they offered for brunch options, but quickly learned they have a a pretty decent size brunch buffet.  I'm not below buffets at all, it's the fat kid in me!  Most things still looked a little questionable to me, but I went for the big ticket items.  Make your own omelets, potato pancakes and dessert.  I'd hit up the buffet again, but still be hasty to check out the regular menu again.  

The omelet was made right in front of you, so I added cheese, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes and onions.  I was super excited about it because it was the size of a football.  Sadly, it was pretty tasteless.  I don't think they added any salt or pepper to the egg mix, so it came out really bland, despite loading up on ingredients.  

But the potato pancakes... I could survive on them forever.  They were amazeballs!  Add some sour cream and I was in potato patch heaven!  I had to keep myself from getting more because of the other thing I loaded up on... dessert.  

The desserts looked unassuming, but they were also awesome.  I had a smattering of delectable bites.  The scones were so moist and tasty.  I had to stop myself from taking more than 20.  I also had some carrot cake, brownies, cookies among other things I inhaled and didn't pay attention too.  Should I be embarrassed?  Probably.  But I don't care because it was darn good!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 6, u'useful': 10, u'cool': 6}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

Most of the churches are so beautiful that it's such a great use of space.  This is no exception, as it's just so unique inside! 

If you're looking for that nontraditional hotel that's NOT a Marriott or Hilton, this is the place you'll want to stay!  It's fashioned like a European boutique hotel, plus all the amenities you'd be looking for like WiFi, a shuttle and continental breakfast (score!). 

It's also a really lovely place to have an event.  For smaller events you can rent out specific parlor's for a reasonable cost and you're able to bring in your own caterers.  I really like this option because you're not boxed into one choice that may be out of price range.  If I would have gotten married in Pittsburgh, this would  definitely have been my first choice for the reception.  The Grand Hall is just gorgeous!  It has the original church organ and stain glass windows.  When it's all dressed up for the event it's just a stunning place for a magical affair! 

The Northside of town, where it's located, has walkable access to the Andy Warhol Museum, The Mattress Factory Museum, The Children's Museum, The National Aviary, The Carnegie Science Center, PNC Park (home to the Pirates, go bucks!) and Heinz Field (home to the Stillerz, as we call them in the burgh).  Some are farther than others, but there's always the shuttle if it's in our frigid winter season.  In the summer, go for the walk so you can take in the sights!

There's also a lot of cute restaurants and bars on East Ohio River Boulevard, which is two streets up from the hotel.  My suggestions would be Bistro to Go and Bistro Soul, Rita's Italian Ice (personal fave) or The Priory Bakery for dessert!  There's also Legends North Shore not far on E. North Ave. about two streets up from E. Ohio and Amani Coffee Shop and Cafe for a quick stop for coffee or a great panini for lunch.   

It's really a fantastic time to go in the summer because EVERYTHING is within walking distance.  Plus they have a great farmers market in the park right along E. Ohio and they have kayaking in the park right by the Aviary.  The big kayaking organization, Venture Outdoors is right under the 6th St. Bridge next to PNC Park.  You're able to kayak around the three rivers for only $15 an hour!  It's a great way to see the city!

When a meal rocks my world, I usually want to lick the bowl clean, yes, like a dog.  I did not, sadly, feel that way about this place.  It IS BYOB but the catch is it's $4 PER glass.  Yep, that's right, not per table my friend.  Keep that in mind.

I got the greens and beans on recommendation from many Yelpers on here.  Maybe I just don't have the taste for it, but I thought it was weird, watery and....not good.  I also thought it was going to be green beans and it was kidney beans and spinach that tasted like a warm Caesar salad.  No thanks....

I ordered the Penne Vodka, which is my fav meal to order at Italian restaurants.  I also like to add a meatball on if it's homemade.  It was, in fact, confirmed to be homemade so I was all over it!  The meatball itself was delicious.  I love a bread-y meatball.  You know the type.  Soft and packed with flavor.  It was the winner of the night.  The vodka sauce was good, but I wanted way more.  Now I have to preface this by saying I'm a total sauce-aholic.  I love me a good amount of sauce, this didn't even come close.

Maybe it's just the built in crowd. You come to a game, you gotta eat, right? And what are you going to eat? Either at a restaurant outside the stadium or inside. At this point I'd stick with inside for the novelty of it all. 

I stopped into Atria's on game day, but came in right as the first pitch was going out, so it wasn't packed in the least. Our server was obviously not into us, as well as serving that day, as she was pretty short with us the entire time. Sorry we bothered you...

The menu is incredibly limited with around 5 apps, 5 sandwiches and 5 main courses. I get that they're probably just limiting things for the crowded times, but I felt like nothing really called to me. I settled on going halfies and ordering an app and waiting until I was inside the stadium to get my ""main course."" Crab fries, naturally. But that's beside the point.

The pieorgies we ordered were okay. They were doused in Parmesan cheese and a little overcooked, but it wasn't the worst thing I've ever had. Wasn't the best either. I think what really turned me off was the whole experience. Service, small selection and mediocre food. I should have just ordered two buckets of crab fries and called it a night!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 3, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 3}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

Like any good museum, they constantly have changing exhibits, so things I saw are probably not there anymore.  But the interactive exhibits are all about participation.

So when it comes to your kitties health, you want someone to take it seriously!  I've thankfully only had to deal with them twice before.  Once for the round of kitten vaccines and neutering.  I believe for the two kittens it was around $175.  

The other issue I had was that my one cat had pretty gross eye junk (obviously technical terms I avoid).  The vet who saw me was incredibly friendly and very gentle with my little furry friend.  They were able to fill my prescription of eye drops right away so I wouldn't have to worry about it coming in.  About $50 later I was on my way.

Washington, this is a welcome change. I actually was excited to move to Dormont knowing we'd potentially have a better place to grocery shop locally.

Kuhn's has absolutely surpassed Foodland. It's clean, has most everything I need and it's at the right price. I'm actually surprised how much variety they offer in such a ""small"" space. Small being the operative word, considering most Giant Eagle's are ginormous. 

I've even discovered new products here, like my delicious Lara Fiber Bars. I'm surprised at the nice gourmet cheese selection, the big deli area and even a counter for fresh seafood. So now I can just run down the block if I need to pick up something quick or do my whole week's shopping here. It's glorious! 

The only thing I wish for is a better parking lot. Since I'm coming off Dwight Ave it's nice to sneak right in. But coming out is another issue. There's only one way traffic around the parking lot. So you're usually stuck waiting behind cars trying to park and pull out. This is very minor though... just an impatient person talking here.

The main point.. it's WAY cheaper than Giant Eagle!

Our relationship started at 16 years old.  It was my first job and continued to supplement my burgeoning shopping addiction throughout High School and into College.  I had a fantastic time throwing people's menus down as a hostess and then filling food orders (and occasionally spilling orange juice on people's crotches, oops) as a waitress and gossiping with my coworkers.  So needless to say, I have a special place in my heart for this lovely establishment!

I think for a Pittsburgh owned chain restaurant it's one of the best.  This is in terms of how the business is run and the restaurants itself.  My love affair of grilled stickies began here.  I may have occasionally shoved one or two in my mouth as soon as they came out of the oven.  I also can't resist a smiley cookie.  They seem to be at every event in the city, so I never have to go long to fulfill on my smiley cookie cravings.  Thank gawd!

My all time favorite salad is the grilled chicken and portabella salad.  I absolutely love the balsamic dressing and mix of fresh ingredients.  I also had a second in High School (when I didn't have to count so many calories, ew) where I'd order a Super Burger every lunch break.  They are seriously addictive with their super secret sauce combination.  

Their breakfast buffet is bomb!  I always have to go for the regulars and one word sums that up.  Carbs.  Pancakes, french toast and those delish strawberry muffins!  And seriously, what is up with how good their pistachio whip is on the buffet?  I used to lick the bowl...after it was already made and served...don't worry for all you germaphobes!

This place is legit!  Moving to the new hood in Dormont means finding a new go to bar.  I need a my hood bar to have a good selection of beer (I accept Yuengling and hopefully a rotating seasonal list) and good bar food.  Good bar food doesn't have to be good.  I mean, it has to be good, but it doesn't have be gourmet poutine, if you know what I'm sayin'?  

Cain's totally surprised me because they have a mega beer list, with lots of drafts on tap, and this particular night Southern Tier Pumking was in the hizzouse!  Their menu is HUGE too!  Tons of faves like wings and burgers but the intriguing ""Codfather,"" which I will take part in at some point!  I was in the mood for a Rachel, because well, why not... it's my name!  

The Rachel was awesome, with a good amount of turkey, but not overwhelming and lots of coleslaw, which is totally how I like it!  The rye was fresh and toasted and it all came together perfectly.  But the fries, the fries win my seal of approval!  They were crisp and seasoned correctly, which is a winning fry in my opinion.

While Pamela's serves up the amazing thin crepe-like pancakes, The Dor-Stop serves up the fluffy equivalent. The list of different combos goes on and on. And if you're with a really good friend, you can order two different ones and split them! Genius!

I split the banana chocolate chip pancakes and the pumpkin pancakes. While the pumpkin was incredible, I think I slightly more enjoyed the banana chocolate chip just because the combo is such a winning one! But come fall, I may be all over the pumpkin ones again. Although, I'd probably be cheating myself because I have to work my way down the list of them all!

The only thing that would pull me away would be the french toast. It almost seems cruel I have to choose between the two! And it's so dirt cheap too! I think for three people it was around $25 bucks. With coffee and some sides!

I have NO green thumb WHATSOEVER, but had passed by for about a year now since I moved to Dormont and had always thought the shop looked cute. Now was my chance as I needed a last minute Christmas present for my grandma. 

The place is larger than you think from the outside. They actually have a whole outdoor area that's covered for the winter with many different plants I couldn't identify. I thought the owner was super duper sweet and just really energetic. Her and another staff member helped me pick out a plant that was in a vase, not in a pot, and looked really cool and modern. I loved it and had a fleeting thought to pick one up myself... if I wouldn't kill it (which I probably would!). 

I had commented about a table full of vases filled with what looked like works of art. They turned out to be flower displays for hotels, but man where they cool. If I was doing an event or having a wedding, that's exactly what I would have wanted. They just looked really modern but creative. 

They also have some winged friends you can say hi to, including one screaming one in the back that you can't see. Kinda creepy, but I guess that comes with a unique shop! I will absolutely be back to pick up items for people and consider them for any events I have coming up."	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 2}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

What I was sad about at this location was the gauc,.  It was, how do you say....okay...it was just plain gross.  It tasted rotten!  Not the way you want your gauc to taste.  And for some reason I kept torturing myself by taking little bites to see what the heck was wrong with it!  The waitress, who was incredibly nice, took it back to see what was up with it.  She said she thought maybe it had too much lime in it.  I love lime and I don't really know how lime can make gauc taste rotten, but I was pretty bummed 

The good?  My Dance Marathaon Enchilada, as always, was a party in my mouth!  And like I said, our waitress was super friendly and a great server!  She suggested to the seasonal Apple Cider Margarita.  I excited and scared all at once!  I've been digging the ciders lately, but in a marg?  A little scary.  First sip tasted a bit like cinnamon apple sauce.  A tad weird.  A couple sips later, I was into it.  I was also into caramel/sugar lining the rim of the glass!  

Solid meal, I just missed the fresh, non weird tasting, gauc.

I know I'm totally biased but I really do feel like this is the best Starbucks in the city!  No other store has such a cozy feel to it.  I may have fallen asleep in the big comfy chairs by the fireplace a couple times.  I mean, it was hard slingin coffee all day!  Especially when you have to get up at 5 AM to be there at 5:30 AM (yeah, I totally rolled out of bed to go to work).  

It gets SLAMMED around 6:30 or 7 with the before work crowd.  I can still remember people's faces and what they ordered.  I could never understand the woman who ordered a Venti (large) 8 pump white chocolate mocha with whip EVERY morning.  I guess girl needed her sugar to survive in the AM.  

The nice thing is they're ALWAYS open.  Much to the chagrin of me and my coworkers with the madness of LIght Up NIght and St. Patrick's day drunken festivities.  But it's nice for the tourists to stop in and grab a quick drink and some advice on where to go downtown on a Saturday morning.  I'm thankful now when I'm downtown on a Sunday because I know it's one of the ONLY places open!  It's just a really great place to meet a friend to catch up or sit and study.  Plus they offer free wi-fi, which is always a plus!

Just remember, Barista's are people too!!  Grunting out ""tall coffee"" instead of a hello doesn't usually fly as a good greeting.

I always hope for the best. I did not, however get the best. Although I would have to say the pretzel bite appetizer wasn't bad. But I really don't think there's much you can mess up. The buffalo pierogies however, was a total miss. 

I do not want to make any accusations, but they did not seem to be freshly made, maybe frozen pre-made ones. And they were covered in hot sauce. It didn't look appetizing, nor did it actually taste appetizing. 

They have half off appetizer specials for food and $5 drinks. But all the special drinks were mixed, and I knew they would probably be way too sweet and frou frou for me. 

I went with a glass of Malbec, which was a good choice. Actually, it was the best choice there.

Nevertheless, this place in the Westin hotel is no different.  For starters, the place is sorely outdated.  The decorations look like they're straight out of an 80's music video.  I went with my mom, who asked me if the glass sculptures on the ceiling where Chihuly's.  I almost choked on my bread when she asked! 

I always go for sushi when it's on the menu at a fish place.  I can't get away from it, plus I need my weekly (or sometimes daily) fill of it!  So I ordered a spicy yellow tail roll and a ginger salad.  The spicy yellow tail was not spicy.  It had a side of ""spicy"" sauce.  I'm not too sure that qualifies it to be spicy with a dab of sauce.  The salad's ginger dressing was awful and watery.  I love ginger dressing when it's done right.  But it was not happening at this place! 

The thing that really made me mad is that the place is overpriced to begin with.  My tiny yellow tail roll was more expensive ($7) than the fabu Penn Ave Fish Co ($5.50) rolls.  And DEF not as good!  My mom ordered a bowl of fish soup.  This ""bowl"" was a deep dish salad bowl and looked as if there was a small ladle size serving.  It was hardly halfway full.  That's all my mom had ordered for lunch.  It was pretty sad looking.  So she asked for a little more from the server.  The server said that's all she could give her because it was restaurant policy.  Now let me tell you....I've worked at restaurants.  I've witnessed the people who eat their ENTIRE meal, then say it was bad and want another one...and they get another one!  Now that's messed up!  Asking for a little more soup, that's supposed to be a BOWL but looks more like a spoonful is hardly too much to ask for. 

Needless to say, I will NOT be back. There are WAY better fish places in the city to fill my belly with, hands down! Go to Penn Ave Fish Co, It's opened a new location right on Fifth Ave! Don't say I didn't warn you!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 3, u'useful': 4, u'cool': 2}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

Cocktails were STA-RONG. My caipirinha was really wicked strong and my Cosmo was pretty much cranberry juice with a splash of vodka. Looking to party, here you go!  Looking to dance...meet me in the middle of the wide dance floor to drop to some pretty excellent DJ tunes.  It's nice that there's wide windows that open up in the summer that people can gawk at you dropping it from the street!

I like that there's actually a business downtown that stays open past 9 pm! You'd be surprised the crowd you get here on any night of the week. Thursdays are salsa night and Friday/Saturday you get a mix up the after theater crowd and the night owls. Throw in a random Steeler (hi Charlie Batch) or Pens sighting and you've got a hip place! I love how the place is decorated like a Mad Mex restaurant that's ready to throw down on the dance floor! 

Although you will always have your creepers....case in point last night. A strange man claiming to work at Saks went around kissing our hands. But who doesn't come out of a bar without a creeper story. It just adds more flavor to the place...or a good story to tell the day after!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 3, u'useful': 6, u'cool': 1}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

But since they have it in the name, the martini list is fantastic, not to mention tastes great!	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 2}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

All this is done with their bare hands, no gloves here, so all you sanitary peeps beware! 

I don't know why it's such a fantastic sammy, but trust, it is!  I think it's just the combination of delicious (and fatty) ingredients that does the job.  It's just one more food experience that makes Pittsburgh's dining unique.

It's almost embarrassing having this place exist in the Strip with so many tourists coming here.  That has to be how they're making their money because it's certainly not on their food or service.  Well, maybe it's the booze too...

I don't even know where to begin.  Service was horrible.  The lunch took 2 hours.  On a leisurely Sunday that may be fine, but there was no leisure.  At least not with drinks not in hand until a 1/2 an hour after we sat down.  I'd say lunch was served another 1/2 to 45 minutes later.  

It didn't matter though, I knew it wasn't going to be anything spectacular.  I'd heard rumors about the food.  I won't go into any details but I wouldn't trust some items on the menu.  I just played it safe and ordered a veggie salad.  

The salad was in the entree section, so I assumed it would be a full size salad.  It was not.  It was a side salad with a handful of grilled veggies on top.  Nothing spectacular.  And a side salad at almost $11.  Not worth it.

You may come out singing ""life is a cabernet savignon"" after throwing back a couple here because, yay, you can drink and eat and eat and drink!

I encourage anyone who loves musical theater (or anyone who just likes to eat and drink in a fun environment) to give this place a try!  It's one of my favorite venue's to see a show because it's a whole experience.  

There's not a bad seat in the house because it only holds about 200 tables.  Plus they have VIP seating in the front, which provides you with some comfy sofa's to sit on.

I'm very excited to see a new caterer come in since the companion restaurant closed next door.  I wasn't too thrilled with the food selections...I really don't know how you make Pizza bad...but they somehow did.  

I loved The Big Bang and I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change.  They honestly do a fantastic job casting the shows.  I have my own personal favorites, it's my own personal fan club of one!

Keep in mind there's discounts if you work for certain corporations, you're a student or you come a in group.  Everyone loves a discount!

I cannot deny myself the sudden urges I have to break out into song and dance.  That's just the musical theater geek in me!  The CLO reminds me of all the reasons I got into theater in the first place.  For the joy of it!

You can tell that they take their time with the casting.  And they may bring in some Dancing with the Stars type celebrities for their shows (Joey Fatone in Producers = FANTASTIC) but the real talent lies in the local pool.  It's an amazing thing to have so many local theaters and still snag the some of the most talented in the city.  I really think the CLO does that.  

It's not just the acting, it's the singing as well, with some power house vocals.  And to my surprise, It's also the dancing!  Honestly, the dancing really blows me away.  They don't skimp on some box step stragglers...they hire the triple threats.  Fo sho!

The one and only complaint I have, which is completely on a preference level is that I'm not a fan of all the show choices.  Was I ecstatic when Into the Woods (my all time fav Broadway show EVER) came?  YES!  Did I see it twice it was that good?  HECK YES!  I hate the show The Producers, but the talent, again fantastic.

I had an adorable vintage dress I had bought in Chicago last summer that was too large in all the wrong places and I kept putting off getting fixed.  I had a seamstress friend look at it and she was even stumped by the darts on the chest and how to exactly go about fixing it.  

LuLu had be try the dress on and did a few simple markings and I was on my way.  She even encouraged me to make it a bit shorter, which I was on the fence about, but ultimately decided to do once she pinned it up.  I think a day or two later (after she had told me a week) she called to tell me it was done.  

Let me tell you, the woman knows her way around a seam!  She worked her magic on that dress so that if fit be like a glove... it as beautiful!  I looked closer and could tell that she completely took apart the bodice to remake it so it fit me in the chest.  But she still kept the look of the dress so that the change was slight and still fit the style.  

Now I'm mentally going through my closet thinking of all the things I'm excited to have her custom fit for me!  And of course, visit LuLu again, because she's so so sweet!

If you have any remote interest in making your home beautiful, this is the place to go for amazing and intricately hand made floral arrangements. From wreaths to potted plants to creations I would never even have imagined could have been made, you can buy it here. 

Plus, you know how you walk into Michael's, gaze at the fake flowers and think: boy do these look fake? Well here they look real as can be, because they are perfectly preserved flowers, and they are gorgeous. 

But that's not all, they have a whole array of living plants in the back, beyond the counter and all the beautiful items. There's large plants, hanging plants, small succulents and more things I can't even name. 

If I could end here, I would, but I can't. Because they also sell hand-made pottery from the owners husband, specialty soaps, lotions and of course, gardening accessories.

I swear he remembers everyone, but even if he doesn't it doesn't matter because he makes you feel like you've been sushi besties forever!

I love going to his stand in Wholey's where he'll just randomly hand me a sample roll.  And the rolls he makes are MAMMOTH!  I don't know about everyone else, but I can wolf down my fair share of sushi and it's really hard to finish a full 2 rolls from him.  

The menu is pretty standard but I'm sure he could whip up any kind of specialty roll you'd like.  Plus, it's all reasonably priced.  It's just great to have this stand in the middle of the fish market to grab some quick sushi from a very friendly face!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 2}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

It all snapped into place for me one day recently.  The sushi rolls he makes are massive, but the taste just isn't there.  He's rushing to make them so fast that as soon as you put your chopsticks around them they completely fall apart.  And the most important part, the fish, doesn't seem all that fresh.  Definitely not as fresh as Penn Ave., which is weird considering he ""lives"" in a fresh fish mecca.  But the thing I think I've really grown to hate that weird brown sauce he puts on everything.  Yuck!  I just can't stand it!  I know I can ask to have it off, but as soon as I seem to remember, it's on there in a flash.

I know it may be cheap and it may be fast, but to me it's just not worth it.

The Miso soup they serve has this weird after taste, and to be honest, doesn't taste like any Miso soup I've EVER had! So on to the sushi, oh yeah, it's gross too!

501	hHUxynhRliO0rdjgPYesOw	2011-03-07	FRur2oRY2qwL-v1-eWR5Gw	5	"We are so lucky to have such an amazing theater community in Pittsburgh.  This unique theater adds so much to the mix!  It's a fantastic theater because they focus on plays, usually with one musical in the mix. There's new works here, like the original show The Chief, about what else, but Pittsburgh Steelers founding owner Art Rooney.  They bring in the classics like A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Important of Being Earnest.  They also have newer works right off Broadway, like The Rabbit Hole and Superior Donuts.  Plus, they bring in Second City every year, which is big in my book because they've spawned a couple SNL cast members!! 

I absolutely LOVE the theater!  I'm a big fan of a theater in the round.  That means there's seating on 3 sides of the stage.  They've also been able to do some really cool things with the stage/set, like making an actual pool for the show Metamorphoses.  My favorite all time show was The Secret Letters of Jackie and Marilyn, which was a world premiere.  The show was about a made up relationship between the two women where they wrote letters to each other.  It was a VERY cool concept! 

They also do a lot of great events like the Mix at 6 for young professionals before a show.  Plus, they understand that most of us under 26 (and of course sometimes above) are broke ho's, they offer $15 tickets!  The great thing is, there's really not a bad seat in the house!

But was that sizzling petite filet good? It was delicious! And ""petite"" meaning 8oz, which isn't even petite in my book!

We came here for the Hubs birthday pick. It had been a really long time since I'd been here, so I was foggy on the details of what to expect, other than steak. We were happy to hear they just started carrying oysters, so we ordered up some Blue Points. I loved whatever lemon/vinegar concoction came with it!

The sides were just okay. We ordered the brussells with bacon and cheesy potatoes. Nothing fabulous, but not bad by any means. Plus, you get complimentary bread. Which you need once you receive the bill. Daaaaaaaaang is it expensive. That's one thing I will always remember! 

One thing I will say is that the service is exceptional. I would expect nothing less. Especially because you gotstabe ballin' if you come here.

In the Strip District you've got to really stand out to pull people inside.  Basically, if it's not Steeler related, good luck!  I wandered in here on a lunch break from work and as soon as I entered I knew I wouldn't regret it!  The unique thing about this store is it specializes in chocolates and other candies from all over the world.  

I had a friend tell me the Cadbury bars made over in the UK were WAY better than the ones made in the states.  I had planned a trip to London and she told me I HAD to make it a priority to buy a bar there.  I had forgotten about it until a Cadbury bar called out to me from the counter in a market over there.  She was NOT kidding!  It tasted amazing!  Not like that waxy tasting ickiness you get from bad chocolate.  It was rich and creamy and amazing.  I could go on and on.  

But BACK to Mon Aimee Chocolat and the great ole' US of A.  Sitting in a display at the store was a Cadbury bar.  It was almost radiating light at this point!  I confirmed with the person working there that it was, in fact, a Cadbury bar straight off the boat, airplane, cruise ship, etc. from the UK!  I was so excited I just had to buy it!  Even though I'm an only child I can be ok with sharing sometimes.  Especially if it's an amazing food!  Since this chocolate was so good I just had to share with my coworkers.  They all thought it was just as life changing as I had described it.  

Of course, since I had discovered this, one of my coworkers had been over to Holland and tried a type of candy that became one of her favorites.  Of course we had to go back to Mon Aimee to see if they carried it and sure enough, it was there!  It's such a treat to have this specialty store here in the burgh!

f you've ever been here you KNOW how beautiful it is! It's a historic landmark and was built in 1927 and restored in the 80's to it's original state. It holds around 2,200 seats and is the third largest stage in the country. As you can see, I'm a total nerd about this theater.

So let me give you some BIG insider tips about seating! Avoid at all costs the outer sides of the Left and Right Orchestra (the floor) in the front. You can actually get a cheap seat if you sit in the back of the Left and Right sides but only sit on the aisle. IF an aisle seat isn't available, go for First or Second Tier. I would rather see the show from far away than half see the show! 

The touring Broadway, Pittsburgh CLO, Pittsburgh Opera and Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre perform here. So go support our local theater! Just remember it's right here in the burgh, it's still a fantastic production and it's cheaper than a trip to NYC!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 5, u'cool': 2}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

Therefor, the beauty and magic of Penn Mac is 50% lost on me.  BUT I still think it's 100% awesome.  That was my math lesson for the day!

You could really spend days in here looking over all the different cheeses, pasta sauces, etc.  The ""prepared"" food section is the best part for me.  There's probably hundreds of different kinds of ravioli, tortellini and spaghetti noodles.  It seriously amazing!  There's no need to think about it, just grab the one with ingredients you like, on a recent trip this was mushroom stuffed tortellini, then grab a sauce.  

You don't have to walk far to wander into the sauce section, which again, houses so many sauces you could swim over to Italy in all of them!  I chose the pesto and garlic sauce to pair with my tortellini.  

The service was friendly, especially for a lost looking soul like me.  I didn't know which pasta to pick and they helped me.  I dropped half my purchases on the floor, a staff member helped me scoop them up.  Good enough for me!

But if there's a wonderful staff, they will lead you in the right direction. In comes a coffee dude that was very knowledgeable and lead me to what sounded like a pretty tasty blend!

I was in shopping for a friend who loves pumpkin coffee, so I made a beeline for the coffee dude and said ""must. have. pumpkin."" Thankfully he knew what I was saying and said he had this special ""harvest blend"" he mixes himself of cinnamon, hazelnut and pumpkin. Sounded and smelled delicious, so I trusted him. 

I sauntered over to the tea wall and saw the many blends of loose leaf tea they have as well. That's my biznas right there! I noticed a Christmas blend that sounded amazing, but sadly they were sold out. Of course, a couple weeks before xmas that would happen! So I stocked up on some Vanilla Creme Stash tea and vowed to come back and take some time to dive into their tea selection. 

For those Strip District wanderers, they have a full coffee bar as well that I'd trust is as awesome as their collection of beans and leaves. Tons of supplies for all your sipping needs are packed into this store as well. If you're a coffee or tea lover, this will be your jam.

509	XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg	2011-01-27	x3s1WW3Iz4xnr62jHsnkEg	5	"I want the pasta trio in ma' belly now! It's hands down the best dish you can get there. Three deeeeliscious pasta's served to you in a never ending skillet! What other wimpy pasta's can compete with that? The OG (short for Olive Garden) doesn't hold a spaghetti noodle to this place! 

I swear you to you I haven't seen the same noodle twice here. They always seem to serve up a dish with some crazy looking pasta that they say the name of and I can never remember. But obviously the best thing about it is the sauce! Oh, the sauce! Meat sauce, sweet sauce, lemon, butter, the list goes on and on. I'll never forget the first time I fell in the love there. I fell in love with this out of this world pumpkin ravioli. I'll never forgot you pumpkin ravioli, NEVER! (This was all said looking wistfully out the window like in a movie montage). 

But don't fear if you need something other than pasta (I don't know why, but let's roll with it). I attended a party there once and we had a a three course meal. First we had a delish caesar salad, which was on the lemony side, just the way I like it! Then we had a choice between meats and a fish and I tried the fillet. It was...to. Die. For! I was very pleasantly surprised that my non-pasta meal was so utterly satisfying. Then came the light and fluffy tiramisu. Now I was officially in heaven! We were also sent home with a goodie bag that included Lidia's Eggplant Pasta Sauce. I tried it a couple days later and it was great! It's a red sweet sauce with a tiny kick to it. I loved that it had eggplant in it because it was something different than your normal meatie balls and sauce combination. 

And lastly, the ambiance is very unique. There's huge windows in the front to gaze out at well, a parking lot. But they're tinted so you have a nice intimate vibe going on. There's also a huge glass Chihuly chandelier hanging in the middle of the restaurant that's gorge! So please, convert over from the OG, you will not be disappointed. And don't worry, they DO give free bread sticks!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 6, u'cool': 2}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

After a couple hit and miss visits with the various pasta trio tastings I had, I'd say I was back in Lidia's good graces with their massive brunch spread.

I will give you ample warning, DO NOT EAT A SINGLE THING BEFORE YOU COME HERE FOR BRUNCH. For realsies. It's a crap ton of food! And the best part? It's a bargain! For $28 you get the brunch buffet, your choice of main course AND a mimosa or Bloody Mary. Isn't that a bloody good time? Why, yes, yes it is. You just have to roll me out afterwards!

The buffet is awesome, with tons of traditional anti pasta's, meat trays, soups and salads. I actually went two weeks in a row (I know... that's a lot!) and got to see that they actually change out the buffet items quite a bit. The first week I went I had a delicious bean salad and artichoke salad. The second week I came they had fried risotto balls, which I promptly had about a million of... and tasty mussels. 

For your main course there's about 12 different options to choose from, including the pasta trio of the day! The first week I went with the Salmon over beans and potatoes. I asked for it rare, and rare it came out! It was very flavorful and I liked the charred pieces. I could have used a few more veggies underneath, but the salmon was so large (about 8oz I swear) that it just took over the entire plate! The second week I had stuffed cabbage and mash potatoes. Odd for a polish meal to be on the menu, but it was delicious. I'd have to say even better than the salmon. I loved stuffed cabbage and the mash potatoes were certainly home made and not instant (could you imagine the horror if they were instant?). 

With all that food it's hard to believe I had room for dessert. But how could you NOT indulge when it's also on the buffet just staring at you waiting for it's chance to be eaten! The first week I took the traditional tiramisu, which was fantastic! I like tiramisu that's not too espresso tasting and this was perfection. Very light and tasty. The second week they had a lemon tiramisu and it was a little slice of lemon heaven. Even better than the regular. I shoved so much in my mouth I thought I was going to throw up.

But I love that it's on the river and they actually take advantage of it! The whole thing is pretty much one giant window overlooking the river. I'm always there clicking pics of the city skyline. 

So how about talking about actually attending some things here? I've been to a handful of conventions here and it's been really well set up. The Home and Garden Show is incredible! It's just floors and floors of exhibits. I thought maybe we'd spend an hour there, but you could easily spend hours or even days! 

I've also spent some time at the Farm to Table Conference and Handmade Arcade. Both have also been really well set up. I like that theirs a good amount of room to walk between aisles. Especially when it gets crowded. 

I've also attended a nice dinner here once and the transformation the room makes between conference and evening affair is surprising. They really do make an effort to not make it seem like a generic convention center. Believe, I've seen some ugly ones!

The only issue you'll run into is parking. I've been there a couple times when even a little bit into an event the parking at the actual convention center is full. Not too bad though because there's close parking in the Strip for cheaper!

I stabbed my fork in the same potato she had settled on and yelled NO! And just think, this is JUST the potato salad from here! 

The burgers are the juiciest biggest most incredible burgers ever! I stick with the cheeseburger because I want to enjoy the burger without any fancy smancy stuff on it. I literally had the first bite of the burger and the juice squirted out the other side. Ok, I know that sounds dirty...but it was SO good!! I haven't strayed much from the burgers, but I did have the tuna melt once and it was good, but nothing compares to the burgers. I mean, that's what you go there for!

Well... The service was super fast, but the server seemed less interested in helping us choose what app or wine to get and more into just getting our orders and darting off. I can't say that she wasn't attentive because I barely finished my wine before she asked me if I wanted another. I'll take that over bad service any day though!

We ordered a couple apps with our drinks and there were more misses than hits. The fries were skinny and bland. The calamari was probably the worst I've ever had, but the crab stuffed portobello's... Awesome! Weird right? 

So honestly I wouldn't be opposed to stopping in again, I'd just be very very careful with what I order. Maybe thoroughly research the other reviews for the good stuff. I mean, hey...

I had wanted to try Thai Cuisine for a while but was held up by their remodel. Since I wasn't in before, I can't compare to the old, but I'm digging the new look! It's fresh and vibrant, with a friendly staff and comfy booths. They're winning with me already...

We were seated quickly, and almost as our butts hit the booth, there was a bowl of fried noodles and sweet n' sour sauce dropped off like lightning! Bonus points! Being totally committed to trying Pad Thai at every Thai place in the Burgh, you know what I ordered. Okay, you really want to know? Pad Thai with shrimp.

So here's the thing. I really liked the Pad Thai noodles and sauce. It was a huge portion that I ate entirely (lay off me, I'm starving!!) and it was very saucy (just the way I like it!). I was not into the shrimp. It tasted fishy. Like suspicious fishy. I couldn't put my finger on it. Was it unfrozen recently? Did it have freezer burn? Was it sitting out too long? I couldn't tell. But the one thing I knew was that it was not fresh. Bummer. It also came with this weird side salad on the plate. It was had a really thick, almost disgustingly so, peanut dressing with a touch of iceberg lettuce. I took a couple bites and gave up. Methinks not!

So mental note, next time don't order the shrimp. But seriously, this was the closest I've had to my favorite Pad Thai in the city, Spice Island in Oakland. I promise you, I'll order something different next time I go back!!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 5, u'cool': 1}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

I feel justified saying that if you're about to drop a good amount of money on a beautiful dress you're only going to wear once on a pretty important day, you should have suburb service. I'd say service here was adequate. I wouldn't say they were incredibly friendly but they were efficient and my dress came in on time and the fittings all went without any hiccups. 

In the huge bridal stores like MB Bride in Greensburg, you feel like a number. They hassle you in and out like cattle. I know it's a huge store, so there's a lot of traffic, but I wanted a more personal experience for something this special. That's why I feel like a boutique experience is the way to go when choosing a bridal gown. 

I also liked the huge selection of dresses. They carry designers such as Maggie Sottero, Lazaro and Jim Hjelm. You can choose from the whole spectrum of classy to couture bride.

With that said, I'm always hesitant to get gnocchi because it never seems to be cooked right. It's always gummy and gross. But the waitress assured me the gnocchi here was homemade and very delicious. I took her advice and was served an incredible plate of melt in your mouth light and puffy clouds of Italian magic! Need I say more? Ok I will.... 

The sauce also tasted delicious and definitely homemade. I was torn between getting the gnocchi or pasta vodka. I would have been totally satisfied with that choice as well. Thankfully, my friend ordered the pasta vodka and I ws able to steal away a couple bites of it. The sauce was fantastic! It was so creamy and had a hint of Parmesan cheese flavor. Cheese makes EVERYTHING better in my eyes (and mouth)! 

Our server was really fantastic and did a great job with input on our meals and also filling us in on some upcoming events. They're having cooking classes and wine pairing nights, which I'm totally into! Such a great way to get people in the door and eating, plus drinking! 

Very quaint and cute inside. I went there Thursday and had to hold myself back from not going there again on Saturday.

If it were to that angle, I'd be hard pressed to say which one would win the shoot out. I liked Cain's because it was clean, tons of beer choices and good bar food. BUT, even though this place is a little darker, a little more ""aged"" as I'll lovingly put it... they had some darn good wings. And beer selection. But those wings. They were crispy, the sauce was tangy and plentiful, plus it was just plain hot wings and they were delicious!

So I head here for a quick pick-up for some three-way switches (ordered by the handyman who was working on my electric at home). I had no clue what I was looking for and had saved a note on my phone. 

I walk in and find the first person I see. A woman who was in a Rollier's apron, standing by a cash register reading the Post-Gazette. I asked her politely if she worked there. She slowly responded ""yeah"" hardly looking up. I read off what I needed from my phone and again, barely looking up, pointed to the back and said ""lighting, in the back.""

I stood there for a second and realized she was blatantly blowing me off. Customer service is so important... and I would expect a locally owned hardware store to have excellent customer service. Why? I guess because the big box stores are cheaper and maybe more accessible. But compared to the excellent service I experienced at Home Depot every time I've been in, this was a real letdown. 

I did find a nicer employee who showed me exactly what I needed in the back, but still.

I asked what they use for their Chai Latte and they said they have their own ""mix.""  I'm here to tell you... I have no clue what they gave me.  I felt like it was peppermint spiced tea, with half water half steamed milk.  It was pretty gross, and wasn't even remotely close to a Chai latte. 

I also tried to make convo with the Barista's.  They were having none of that.  They just wanted to work, I guess.  Maybe jam to their awesome playlist, which I can definitely give them credit for.  

Their desserts and pastries looked amazing!  So I had to take home some cookies.  I chose a sugar cookie and mexican cookie.  The sugar cookie was that weird crumbly kind.  I like doughy goodness.  I'm not wasting my calories on a bad cookie.  The mexican cookie was just the same consistency.  Ugh!

Too bad, the place is super cute, but in my opinion it's an utter fail.  Oh wait, free internets.  Not a total loss...

She hesitated and then went on this whole diatribe about how it used to be free, and then it wasn't and now it kinda is, but she wasn't sure.  I swear that's exactly what she said.  So she hesitantly gives me this paper, pulled off from a whole stack mind you, of the Internet name and password.  At this point I'm confused...do you not want me to be here?  Is it free?  I finally got my answer when I logged on with no issues, it's free.  Why all the hassle??

The only reason I can see (and seriously a big one) is the coffee shop hanger on-ers.  I can only imagine how this has become an epidemic in spots like this.  Hip spots with lots of students and recent grads who want to scope out the free internet havens.  I get it....the coffee shop wants you to get your coffee, hang out for approximately 2 hours and leave.  I'm sure this is not the case...and that people hang out enough that they could easily put on an apron and handle orders behind the counter.  So long story short, this place is PACKED.  Packed like you usually have to take a couple laps to find a free table....or even lone chair!  It's a little annoying. Plus, you're most likely going to see what the person next to you/on top of you is doing.  Oh, sweet game of chess there dude....

Oh yeah, my chai was okay, Oregon Chai Mix (my third fav after a homemade mix or Intellegentsia).   Made exactly how I ordered it, extra hot, which a lot of people do not do correctly (it needs to burn my tongue, for realz).

But now... wow! It's really a beautiful space. They must have replaced the lounge and the drink menu... because now it's memorable!

We were sitting there enjoying the open air windows looking onto the street, as the slight summer breeze rolled in, trying to figure out if this was an unused space or a new building they bought. Either way, the expansion is incredible! 

I truly enjoyed sitting in the lounge sipping on some pretty phenomenal cocktails. I think sometimes I just assume Meat and Potatoes and Acacia are going to be the joints were I'm going to enjoy a stellar cocktail and that's it. But how narrow minded of me? I should be equal opportunity cocktail, right?! 

I loved the Docksider (silver rum, aperol, agave nectar, grapefruit bitters, lemon, basil). I'm super into any cocktail with grapefruit, because that equals refreshing to me, and less sweet. But what blew me away was the Rebellion (beet infused wigle whiskey, luxardo maraschino). I love beets, so if you don't, this may not be the drink for you... BUT I thought it had a light beet taste with just the right amount of whiskey. And those maraschino cherries. Geez. I could eat gallons of them!

We also sampled some grub from the menu. The spicy noodles were very good, with just the right amount of spice to make my noose run (a sign of good spice). I could have used a touch more veggies, as the mushrooms were very good, but I find noodle dishes never have enough veggies in them. I thought the pork rolls were okay as well as the calamari, but really dug the yellowtail sashimi. Fresh and delicious. Like it should be! 

I want to try every single drink.

Seriously folks, if you're looking for a nice night on the tahn, look no further!  And my words of advice: DO THE OMAKASE TASTING MENU!  There's really nothing more to tell you other than you will find it incredible, I guarantee!  

The Omakase tasting menu is either a seven course or eleven course dinner with dessert.  It's indulgent and worth every penny (at $85 and $130 respectively).  The plates served to you are small, but honestly not as small as I thought they'd be and the desserts, seriously, massive!  

We had the salmon tartare, sawara seared with hot sesame oil, fluke sashimi, black cod with miso, tuna shashimi rock shrimp tempura and an array of sashimi (toro, snapper, salmon, tuna and saward).  Honestly everything was fantastic and fresh, just like fish should be.   

Like I said, the desserts were all amazing and most of the choices were very rich.  I really enjoyed the chocolate maki and the inventive house made ice creams.  

The overall experience blew me away.  From the service, to the food to the atmosphere it's a perfect 5 star place and if you live here and haven't been, don't wait any longer!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 7, u'cool': 3}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

Probably not the most popular past time, but you can't knock it until you've tried it!  And... You MUST try this place!

This is a proper setting for such an event, you almost feel like you need white gloves and a parasol!  And surprise, the Inn is actually an Inn!  Apparently it dates back to the olden days of yore (late 1800's) and is one of those old Shadyside mansions that was converted into an Inn at some point.  But if you have relatives who want something more unique in the heart of a vibrant Burgh neighborhood, I'd suggest here!

Let's get to the tea service though!  It's served from noon to four daily, which is nice for a ""ladies who lunch afternoon"" or a Saturday or Sunday outing for mom.  It's in a parlor, which is small but charming.  There's also an outdoor patio that would be nice if it's not too hot out (drinking hot tea in 80 degrees isn't too appealing).  There's a full High Tea Service for $20 per person, which seems a little steep, but for tea service isn't too bad.  There's also other combo's for around $12, but I'd say go big or go home!

The tea menu is VERY large and there were tons of choices. They give you the main choices between black, green and herbal, but you can also blend them together too.  I chose the caramel vanilla, which I guess is being taken off the menu sadly.  It was delish though... so maybe they'll bring it back at some point.  There were honestly a lot of different ones I would have been more than happy with too!

The one thing I think is very cool and very different is that they offer you a different tea selections with the different tiers of food.  I've never heard of them doing that before.  Usually you get one tea choice and that's it.  I love that you can pair the foods together with different teas for no up-charge.  Very unique and a definite perk of coming here.  

I've been to several High Tea Services and this one would definitely be on the light side.  The portions were small, but surprisingly filled me up for the entire afternoon until a later dinner.  I mean, it's tea service, not a five course meal!  There was a chicken and egg salad sandwich and a mushroom and cream cheese on a crisp baguette.  The winner was absolutely the mushroom and cream cheese choice.  It was amazing and I definitely could have eaten ten of those!  

There were two scone choices of blueberry/peach and lemon/lemon ginger.  Those were actually surprisingly tiny.  I thought they were both moist and fresh, but I would have loved them to be a bit bigger because they were so good and I love to slather clotted cream on them!   Oh, and there was also fresh fruit.  Which is great and all, but more scone please!

The last tier was the desserts.  Forgive me for not being accurate enough, but there was a delicious chocolate piece, cheesecake with lemon curd and blueberries.  Loved the chocolate, but I like my cheesecake plain.  While it was good it wasn't life changing.  BUT, the coconut macaroon was honestly thee best macaroon I had EVER had.  Again, ten of those in my possession would have been scarfed down in like 5 seconds.  I would buy a batch of those if I could!  Seriously, can I??

I can't wait to bring my mom here, total mom place fo sho!  But I also love it for myself too!  Or for a bridal shower... If I could do another one (since I'm married I don't think that's proper).  But it's a great place, that's what I'm trying to say and I'll for sure be back to get my proper English lady on!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 11, u'cool': 1}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

The place is small.  They didn't lie to me when I made the reservation.  Of course we had to pick the busiest day and time, Saturday at 7pm.  The nice lady on the phone told me a reservation helps but we may still have to wait.  I did appreciate that tip from her.  

Sure enough, we showed up and it's PACKED!  The unfortunate thing is it was cold, so eating on their patio was not going to happen.  Therefor, people cram into what tiny space is allowed in the front.  But when I say tiny, I really mean no space at all.  An older man pretty much barked orders at us and demanded to know if we had a reservation.  Thank God we did, I was a little scared of him when he ran off muttering about no seating in you ain't got reservations.  

So the first table of the restaurant is thee worst, because people are standing on top of you jealously staring down at you and your food.  Of course we ended up with that table!  Thankfully, our server and anyone else helping out was extremely friendly and helpful and made us feel comfortable.  

We started with the mussels app.  It came in a light garlic sauce and was a good amount of mussels.  I'd say they were pretty tasty and I loved dipping the bread into the sauce.  The bread actually became my best companion that night... more on that later!

I ordered the gnocchi with tomato sauce and mozz cheese.  I LOVE when Italian restaurants dump the sauce on and this was a winner.  I LOVE SAUCE!  I know some people aren't into that, so I'll warn you if you like light sauce, you WON'T be happy.  After having gnocchi at Il Pizzaiolo in South Hills earlier that week (I know, I'm on an Italian kick!) it didn't hold a candle to those light little pillows of pasta and potato.  The sauce though, delicious!  

Much to my husbands chagrin, I had a hard time keeping myself from grabbing his plate!  He had the spinach and ricotta ravioli, which I didn't have have a bite of... but the SAUCE.... oh my!  Orgasmic!  I love tomato cream sauce and this was amazing!  I kept dipping my bread into his sauce, with him increasingly getting annoyed.  Did I want to risk a fight for that delicious sauce... maybe!!  It was soooo good!  

But the real action took place as we were finishing up our meal.  I had noticed the older dude/owner walking around with a glass of red wine the whole time.  I thought that he was pretty rude, but kinda funny, in a typical Italian way.  Well, I start to sense a commotion beside me and realize the owner and a server are in a heated convo.  Then the older dude screams ""get outta here you F*%& A@#hole!"" and then shoves him!  Whoa!!  

I was shocked a boss would do that to an employee.  Come to find out it's his son.  A woman, who I assume was also part of management (maybe even a family member!), came over to our table and apologized, joked this was normal Italian behavior and offered us free dessert.  I thought that was really nice of her and and appreciated.   

I just feel bad because those kind of things take down a business.  The good was great, but witnessing that, you wonder how long you can work like that.  Hopefully the dude can retire to a nice Italian villa with lots of wine instead of screaming at his son in the middle of his restaurant!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 11, u'useful': 10, u'cool': 3}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

You come here with a friend who's also never been here, they may think you're taking them somewhere scary.  Thankfully, neither of those are true!  

As soon you walk in the door, you're comforted by the fact that it's just a cozy little basement restaurant!  Coming here at 2pm on a weekday, you'll also be joining the ladies who lunch, just fyi, this is Shadyside after all!  I actually got the idea to come later (after the lunch rush) because of the Yelp reviews.  Good thing I did because the ladies who lunch had taken every table except for one!

Looking at the menu, the first thing that struck me was that this wasn't a lunch place!  Most of the crepes are of the sweeter persuasion.  Which is usually a-okay with me, but I was starving for some sustenance, so I needed to go with the savory.  I choose the veggie crepe, with mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes.  The crepe itself was nice and fluffy, with a good amount of veggies in the middle.  I thought it was the perfect amount and even came with a nice side salad, which included mandarin oranges.  

Now I know a lot of you will say, why not just go for the sweet then, but I've gotta have my savory before I have my sweet.  I know, I'm a weirdo!  But, I had a little bit of my friends dark chocolate and banana crepe and it was just a delicious teaser to what will most certainly be my future dessert here!  

Hot Tip:  Cash only!  Come on off peak times because it's tiny and you'll be hard pressed to find a seat during lunch hours or Saturday/Sunday brunch."	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 5, u'useful': 6, u'cool': 4}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

If you're into making your own jewelry, this is thee store for you.  There's just rows and rows of beautiful beads from different parts of the world.  Really, anything and everything you can think of from pearls, to amethyst to crystals and many many more is right in front of you to purchase.  Of course, this type of hobby will probably set you back a pretty penny...but I'm sure if you're investing in these pieces you're going to be making some gorgeous jewelry!

If you are not into making your own jewelry but love unique and one of a kind pieces, this store is ALSO the store for you!  They have amazing handcrafted necklaces, bracelets and earrings.  But what really caught my eye was the incredible rings.  Maybe because they were actually in my kinda sorta price range, but again, they were just so unique.  Stone rings, glass rings, crystal rings.

I hadn't been here in a really long time, so I felt like I had to try the food again to write a proper review.  

We got the ""best seat in the house"" according to the host.  That actually means the seat by the window so you can people watch.  Everything looks good on the menu, so I opted for a little bit of everything.  I started with the cauliflower soup.  I didn't know what to expect, but it came as pureed with a cheesy taste to it.  It was amazing!  I asked the server what was in it and she said it was cream cheese.  Mystery solved, cream cheese makes everything better!  

I also tried the beat salad.  I loved the fact that there was golden and red beets in it.  I just wish there were more, although I always feel that way about beet salads at restaurants it seems.  The main course was the Walnut Crusted Salmon with Bread Pudding and Apple Buerre Blanc.  It was really tasty.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, which meant not over cooked at all, and the bread pudding/apple buerre was really delish!  

Our server was incredibly friendly and attentive and I really couldn't ask for a better meal.  I've been won over and I'd definitely go back...and try ten things again:)"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 5, u'cool': 2}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

But Burgatory was closed for a watermain break and that was the only viable option. I'm really glad it was though, because it really was delicious. Honestly, it was very very good. I ordered the portobello sandwich, with melted swiss cheese and caramelized onions. It was funny because I asked for wheat bread (which Subway does have!!) and they said ""we only serve white.""

We came here for Sunday brunch, craving some delicious breakfast food.  I think I almost had a heart attack at how CHEAP it was.  For barely $4 you get eggs, a choice of meat and toast.  I mean, seriously!

I actually opted for the Country Omelet, which was ham and provolone cheese, onions, peppers, mushrooms and tomatoes.  It was an packed omelet with a crap ton of cheese!  It had to be like 3 or 4 slices!  It also came with home fries and wheat toast.  The home fries were okay, but I like crispier slices than what I got.  

The service was extremely friendly.  Seriously went out of their way to check on you, get things for you and just be plain nice!  It is incredibly appreciated.

I discovered no paper towels in the the bathroom and told the server.  She whispered to me that they don't keep paper towels in the bathroom anymore, but at the front counter.

532	Oi8IOoJOEX9JZYK65fUrrA	2014-02-24	KmGSFX5PuHbxpw8qZIUQZw	2	"Well... I'm surprised they offer a brunch menu. I actually only thought it was a bar. Come to find out they have a dining room next door. Seems kind of like a diner. Which brings me to my next point. It was okay diner food. 

The brunch menu actually looked pretty promising with some delicious looking breakfast sandwiches. Since I wanted something a bit lighter, I went with the omelet loaded with veggies and cheddar cheese. I didn't realize it came with potatoes until I got it in front of me. Plus toast. Which is nice, but I wish I would have been told from my server so I could have ordered wheat... if they had it. The omelet was okay, but the veggies were still kinda hard, like it wasn't cooked very long. And the homefries weren't very crispy, which in my opinion is the best way to do them. 

So here's the weird thing. Everyone ended up getting their food in shifts. We had a party of 8, so it was pretty large, but we were literally the only party in there other than another four top. First shift got their breakfast sandwiches. They'd eaten most of their meal by the time the second shift got their waffles. The third shift was 3 people who'd ordered omelets. 

It just seemed odd that it took so long in between. I wouldn't have noticed much if it was by a few minutes. But it was a good fifteen or more. It wasn't horrible, because there was good company, but it definitely wasn't the best service I'd had. 

Not sure about the bar area of Hambone's, but I probably wouldn't come back for brunch."	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 7, u'cool': 2}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

Good thing, because the stuff they sell is ADORABLE!  I was ecstatic to find vintage strawberry ornaments to display on my tree and Christmas and perhaps year round in my red themed kitchen.  

They also have vintage aprons and handkerchiefs, which i know are popular amongst some of my friends.  My winning items (other than the ornaments) are the vintage jewelry they have.  There's some necklaces, a fair amount of clip on earrings and a really good selections of pins.  I know a lot of people tend to make the pins into necklaces these days...so it's a wise investment. 

They also carry gift items such as cards, baby items and home goods.  But obviously their main business is upholstery.  I glanced at a couple of swatches and just imagined what could be done with them!  You can custom make chairs, pillows and window treatments.  I if I had a million dollars....

I literally can't go there anymore because of the smell. I know it's because of the brewery and the yeast they use for the beer. But ugh....I can't shake it. I smell it when I come in, I smell it when I eat and I smell it on me after I leave. 

It's such a shame too because the place is just gorgeous! Obviously, it used to be a church and they've kept a lot of the original stain glass windows. Even the pews and tables you sit at are originally from the church. 

I.just.can't.take.the.smell. 

Also, I'm not really a fan of the beer they brew. I've tried it a bunch of times and it just never seems to stand out for me. The food is not bad either. I've had the pizza's, which are offered in a variety of different types. I seriously just can't take the smell. 

I'm sure I'll get talked into going again sometime, but hopefully it's in the summer when I can sit outside. The outside does have a great set up. Plus, you don't have the smell.

I've seen Dr. Siegel for years now and he's always done an excellent job.  But the real testament to the practice is that I've actually seen two other newer Dr's here and they've both also been extremely friendly and helpful.  The last Dr. I saw, Dr. Klescz, comes highly recommended from me, she was just as great as the others!

I also think they do a fantastic job following up with you, whether it be with your annual exam or your order for contacts or frames.  Even if you call and leave them a message they always call back the same day.  That's a great trait to have in a business that I appreciate with something as important as my sight!  

The absolute only complaint I have is that I wish they had a funkier selection of specs.  I think they have a wide selection and I DO think the selection has gotten a little better in the past year with the addition of Betsey Johnson frames (yes!) so hopefully they keep going in that direction.  

The BEST piece of secret info I can give you....that stupid puff test you do for glaucoma that always makes you jump away like a crazy person....you can opt to have them check it out without the puff!

I hadn't been to Pipers in a while so I felt like I needed another visit to properly review the place.  I got super excited about going there when I tried their Guinness Stew at an event last week so I was set on ordering that because it was so delicious, even in a buffet style!  But then at the last minute changed my mind, being tempted by the Lamb and Smoked Chestnut Shepherd's Pie.  It was so savory!  The Scottish Ale gravy was so thick and tasty and those crispy potatoes on top?  It was like icing on top of a delicious cake!  I am NOT one to forget about the sweet things in life, but this was such a hearty meal that there was no way I could have eaten dessert after such a hearty meal.

It's great the renovations that have gone into this little deli. Over the last year they've added a beautiful new bar and added to the patio out back. I don't know what more they could do other than buy the whole block! 

My go to is always the chicken salad sandwich. I love me a good chicken salad. Like the one with mayo. I say the one with mayo pointedly because I LOVE MAYO! And a lot of it. So if I order a chicken salad sandwich I want a good amount of mayo. I always try to duplicate them at home and it never has the flavor that this does. Plus, I love the Breadworks bread! i could eat a whole loaf and be one happy camper.

I also think they have a nice selection of sides as well. I usually go for the tomato and cucumber salad, but I'll switch it up with coleslaw or potato salad once in a while. I try not to go too mayo heavy on the sides since I get my fill in the sammie! But there's a good amount to try from including pasta salads or you can grab some chips. 

I think it's so cool the owner Mike's dedication to local brews. All of his taps are 100% local. Local as in, around the Western part of PA (Erie included... holla!). We've got some good places to choose from, that's for sure! Plus, he does samplings on Wednesdays and hosts regular nights were the reps come in and talk up their brews. 

If you can't stay you can also browse the 300+ bottles of beer they sell to take home. So you've got lots of different options. All of which hopefully end up with beer involved!

There's even a full working kitchen... which probably comes in handy for caterers. 

If I was getting married (again:) or looking for a large event space I'd look here. You could really work some cool themes into the event. I'd love to do a Mad Men themed event here, it just seems to lend itself to that era. But I kinda think you could do anything with the venue. 

The only thing that would be an issue is that you would absolutely need to hire a valet service.

It's locally owned right in the heart of the hip South Side area.  You'll definitely need a reservation for most nights of the week as it is ALWAYS busy.  You may pay for the ambiance but it's definitely worth it for the food.  For drinks try the Key Lime Pie Martini, for an app try the Hawaiian roll and for the habachi try the filet mignon or tuna steak.  They melt in your mouth!

What happened? Did I change? Did this place change? I think it's a little of both. Maybe I can compare it to a relationship. Yes, that's it. Things were awesome at first. We were in love and everything was just perfect. The sushi was fantastic and fresh. The habachi was so delicious I wanted to lick my plate.

Then over time things started to deteriorate. The sushi didn't taste like my beloved Penn Ave Fish, my new amore. The habachi was missing something. Did the soup recipe change? Not as much flavor. Did the portions get smaller. Where did my sprouts go?! Things started to head south...

The last straw was the whole atmosphere or Club Nakama we'll call it. The music is pulsating techno. The crowd is judge-y. The service is lacking. And the food, it's nothing special. Sad, because what once was, is no more:(

Or the Care Bears I sold at a family garage sale because I got greedy and wanted the $5 instead!  

It's just a sight even if you're not intending to buy anything.  It takes you back to the days spent playing with toys instead of perhaps playing on the internet all day (or working, you choose).  I'm sure if you're an avid collector of ""vintage"" toys this is a dream come true for you!  I feel like they have everything across the board from the 50's-today.

I've been meeting more and more unboring sammies lately, which has made me actually start to crave them!

I had wanted to stop into The Pretzel Shop for a while and had heard they also serve sandwich and not just pretzels.  They actually have a whole case full of sandwiches and sides.  I opted for the turkey sandwich with horsey dressing on a pretzel bun (dah!).  

That pretzel bun... AMAZING!  It was so moist and doughy, and not too salty (which I hate about regular ones).  I also loved the tangy dressing.  It honestly made me want to come back and buy up the whole store of pretzels, that bun was so good!  You could probably buy the whole store for $20 everything is so cheap, cheap, cheap!

I carefully picked the word ""experience"" because it's not just packing yourself into a concert venue and seeing a dot in front of you that's supposed to be a performer.

Here, you're up close and personal, and that's what music is all about. I came to see Martha Wainwright and it was just that. I saw her as not a dot, but a person performing some great songs right in front of me. Sounded great and went with the chill environment of people sitting enjoying the tunes.

Best part? Okay, well, other than the music was Atwater Vanilla Java Porter on tap! I'm so into that beer, and on tap!? Amazing! Looking at the chalkboard of drafts, their list seemed pretty solidly stacked with the goods. Plus, with a new brunch service, I'm definitely going to be visiting more often.

If you created a bar in a cave, this would be exactly what it would look like.  It's dimly light with red lights illuminating the rock walls.  You can hop into one of the little seating coves or grab a table with swirly looking chairs.  Nothing about this bar is boring as far as ambiance goes.

As busy as the bartenders are, they're super friendly and quick.  I told the bartender chick to make me something fun and she whipped up this delicious cocktail she called the refreshing side of a margarita.  Wasn't too sweet, but had just the right kick to it (thanks tequila!).  I loved it!  At $4 it's a steal too!

There's also a decent DJ on Saturday nights with a small dance floor in the back to werk your thang.  I appreciate a place that let's me werk it on the weekends!

Big thing here is, it's an antique shop that also has awesome vegetarian food!  So being a antique shop, they draw upon that for all their decorations in the dining room area.  It's like walking into your quirky grandma or aunt's house. 

The food could stand alone, without the antiques shop.  I ordered the lentil burger for the first time ever.  I can happily report back that it was absolutely delish!  It was HUGE and packed full of goodies (what I found out was, lentils, bread crumbs, potatoes, etc.).  The burger kinda fell apart after a few bites so I opted to eat with a fork.  No worries, it still tasted good!  It also came with a side of chips, but I opted out because of my lame diet and ended up getting a side salad.  The side salad acted more like a full salad, it was served in a tiny bowl stuffed full of fresh lettuce, peppers and grapes!  

Since I'm a huge fan of tea I was also super excited to see such a massive tea list.  I choose the Almond Spice black tea and am happy to report it was super tasty.  Loved that it came out in a pot all for myself!  I love my own personal tea parties!

The antique side is, of course, filled with a plethora of chachkies.  But there's many many treasures to be found!  I totally dug a couple of awesome 70's style dresses that inspire me to find some kind of 70's themed party (or throw one!).  I thought the vintage costume jewelry selection was awesome though!  It was a win win for me walking out of there with a full belly and a $12 vintage bracelet!

I needed something printed and fast! I called to get the info since I'm usually more comfortable talking with someone about the process person to person than just submitting something.  From start to finish the service here was stellar.  Everyone was super nice and helpful when I spoke with them and had questions.

You submit your file online and then they'll call with an estimate.  They called me shortly after to confirm everything and then called me a couple hours later when it was done.  I was so pleased with their service I used them for a bigger job later on.

Second time I used them I had them print off posters and postcards.  I had no clue how to do this and they helped me choose the kind of paper and cut.  It looked beautiful when I picked them up two days later.  They were nice and glossy and cut perfectly.  

The price wasn't bad, although I don't have a lot to compare it to.

My fav Giant Eagle is the one in the Waterfront.  But since I live in Mt. Washington sometimes it's just not worth it to sit in traffic on 376 when I need a mid week grocery run but don't have the time to battle traffic.  This is my middle resort, considering the Mt. W Foodland is the absolute LAST resort (ONLY for canned food).  

A cop greets you as you walk in the door, nice touch. There's also usually at least a couple people having a very nice conversation, with themselves...It's great entertainment while you're trying to find the whole wheat spaghetti.  

They're usually pretty well stocked and have mostly everything I need.

I feel like The Beehive has probably hosted many area teenagers over the years.  Most of those teens have probably made their mark, literally, on the walls and tables of this place.  

But alas, I am a teen no more.  Just trying to keep ""hippity hop"" like the rest of those youngins.  So for me, it's just not that type of place I can get into.  For others I'm sure it is.  Possibly a place that gets better at night...when you involve a dimly lite room, alcohol and karaoke.  

Keeping it old school...like way old school...they do not take credit card.  A little irritating but I do understand that those transactions cost the owners money and I want to support the local biz scene. 

I did appreciate the incredibly friendly service I received from the Barista and the delicious Apple Cinnamon Iced Tea I drank in like five seconds.

552	B1DExytz6yB4PkAqqXxLuA	2011-06-17	79dLNtmSKcZadkKlKvFnDg	1	"This is a sad little story about a young spirited 21 year old me.

I had finally lost that horrid freshman 15 (or 30, but who's counting) and felt like I needed some pizazz in my life....or shall we say on my body.  So naturally I decided the right thing to do was get a belly button ring.  Hey, everyone was doing it.  I was 21, not 16, mind you.  Maybe I should have realized my window of prancing around with a belly button laden with jewels was quickly growing smaller. 

I actually LOVED piercings!  I had 9 in my ears and had always wanted an eyebrow ring when that was the fad.  So this just seemed like the next logical step.  No taking in and out, it was there to stay....or so I thought!

The piercing was a total breeze and I ran out to look at my beautiful little belly button ring and realized...dun dun dun...it was pierced crooked!  And not just tiny bit off, but it literally hung to one side.  At the time I was too nice to say anything ,as I was raging on the inside.  I just skipped out of there with my friends, silently cursing the dude who pierced me.

Over the next couple months I kept telling myself that it wasn't crooked.  I would always try to move the ring over to the other side.  So then only a couple months later (avert your eyes if you're squeamish folks) the hole tore and got infected.  I went back and they took out the ring and my youth was, in an instant, taken away from me.  

Ok, I lied in that last part, I still think I'm 21.  But I was pissed my days of showing off by bedazzled belly button had to end that way!  I guess it's for the best (sigh) since my belly button doesn't see much light these days.

Sketchy looking building. Check.
Enter through a kitchen and dine in someone's living room. Check.
Eat Hungarian food from an older man who makes everything in said kitchen. Check.
Communal dinning with strangers. Check.

It's definitely a one of a kind experience. So for $15 you get 6 courses. Yep, that's right... SIX! And seriously, all the second helpings you could ever want. They literally tell you to clear off the plate or bowl before removing it from the table! 

It was a packed house, with three parties of 8-10 people, and then we were the odd ""man"" out with a party of 5. The problem was, the tables sat about 12, so we had to split up between two tables. Not necessarily ideal, but we made it work. Especially because the 2 of us who has together had a pretty fun table to converse with... I don't think that can be said for the other 3. But my only real suggestion for the place is to schedule the seating a little better.

I don't even know where to start with all the food. Some dishes were really really good, while others were just okay. Maybe I'll start with the okay. The first dish, the fried dough and mushrooms (sorry if there's a proper Hungarian name for this that I don't know) was just okay. The mushrooms tasted like they had come out of a can. Maybe they didn't, but they weren't flavored very well. The peasant soup was good. It was peppery, which I appreciate and tasted more like chicken noodle soup.

Everything else, I can say, was very tasty. I didn't realize Hungarian culture shares Haluski as a dish. I love Haluski, but think it can easily be bland. Not with this. Again, it had enough pepper and even salt to satisfy me. The sauerkraut and pork was great and the pork was very tender. I'm not even a big pork fan and thought it was good. But the thing I will remember the most is the goulash and chicken. I NEVER order chicken at restaurants. I don't like cooking it at home. I'm just not a big fan. But this was the best, most flavorful and tender chicken I've ever had. It was delicious! That is saying a lot from me, an anti-chicken gal! 

It was really cool at the end because Alex, the owner and cook, came out and talked about Hungarian history. You think about how America has become such a melting pot, you don't know if you'll get this kind of experience a decade from now. It just was very heartwarming to hear him speak so passionately about Hungarian culture."	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 6, u'cool': 5}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

You can totally tell this is a spot that sees repeat costumers day in and out. We had an early dinner at 5pm and it was packed with families and couples. The decor reminds you of a ski chalet, it's quite cozy. All you needed is a roaring fireplace!

We read the reviews about the battered shrimp, so we started off with that as an app. They were very good, and I believe that breadcrumb family recipe is legit. Plus, the cocktail sauce was surprisingly good. But the main dishes we split, between the rainbow trout, almondine cod and seafood platter were a little bland. 

The real treat is the pies, as I stated earlier. Most are cream pies, offering their famous coconut cream pie, but also banana cream, chocolate cream and an apple pie, among other choices... I kinda zoned out after my excitement set in for the coconut pie. 

It was light and fluffy and delicious, just like you'd expect it to be. Toasted coconut flakes just topped it off. I hear the owner bakes a bunch of pies in the morning and you get what you get by the end of the day, so I was glad to enjoy the coconut one!

Plus, the thing that really bugged me was that the shop REEKS of smoke!  Seriously, it's disgusting!  Who wants to come into a place that's supposed to be filled with things that are supposed to be beautiful and smell nice and ""rosy"" and instead smell like an ash tray.  Very unprofessional in my opinion.  

It's too bad because they're the only flower shop on the Mount, so I'd they get a lot of business from the two funeral homes as well as business from the city.  Maybe that's why they stay in business, people don't actually step inside the shop.  It's just weird to me, right?!

The only issue I have with this place is that it's usually ALWAYS packed in the summer!  But that's because....

Number one:  It's on one of the main streets in Mt. Washington
Number two:  It's a tourist trap
Number three: It's the only ice cream place on the street!  

There you go, no competition!  The owner HAS to make a killing scoopin out the cones in the summer, for sure.

My fav flavor is the Birthday Cake ice cream.  It has cake, frosting and sprinkles mixed in.  YUMMO!  I was not a fan of the chocolate milkshake only because I don't like chocolate ice cream (I know, I'm weird) and they make it with that and choco syrup.  Too much!  If you're looking to go all out, the Brownie Sundae is divine!  

So try to go on the off peak times like....the winter?

Dear Fox's Pizza Den:

You are two blocks away from my house, yet sometimes I am too lazy to come get your delectable food offerings.  You don't judge me.  You just bring your delicious treats right to my door.  

I love you for your regular pizza with my favorite doughy crust, real mushrooms and enough tomato sauce for all my saucy needs.  I also love you for your specialty white pizza.  I enjoy your white pizza for its mozzarella, tomato and spinach winning combination.  Sometimes I'll even throw in our friend chicken to add in some much needed protein.  But most of all (and surprisingly) I love you for your ""healthy"" option, the Taco Salad.  Fresh lettuce, tomato, onion, tortilla pieces, SOUR CREAM, taco flavored beef and salsa.  Who am I kidding, you're not healthy at all....but I love you anyway!

Their burgers are tasty, nacho platter is delish and the fry platter is to die for! Of course they have a full bar and a pretty good selection of beers, they even have Blue Moon on tap! The indoor area is pretty average with a dart board and jukebox but the outdoor area is really great! It's spacious and great for people watching in the summer and they cover it and put heat lamps out in the winter. There's also a big screen TV outdoors to watch the Stillers or Pens play.	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

Love this place! I'm sure it's because this is my neighborhood watering/beering hole. Great bar food, especially the mozzarella log, I kid you not on the name!) and delicious wings (hmmmm honey bbq!) I can't even describe the way the loaded fries taste, especially after midnight....

You know how bars surprise you and have some rando food item that's delish? They have awesome and I do mean AWESOME german potato salad that I have tried to replicate at home without ANY success! I also enjoy any bar that has Blue Moon on tap, because I feel like those can be few and far between. 

I can't say much for the inside but they have remodeled the outside area quite extensively. It's a great place to sit in the summer and in the winter they have a tent set up with heat lamps. AND, they just recently added a fake fireplace for true ambiance. It's right next to the huge flat screen TV. Romantic.... 

So maybe the waitresses are a little grumpy at times, I can deal for the food and beer. And let me tell you, places don't do well in Pittsburgh if you can't get a special on SOMETHING! They have a special every single night of the week, niiccce!

561	_WaHLgLzALd2iThQAhC-sQ	2011-02-06	jd_4XFO2iZe4463OQTBBdQ	4	"Ohhhh those frozen Cosmo's! They pack a punch and by punch I mean you could really drink a couple and be faced down somewhere you don't remember being! SO GOOD! I was safe and stuck with one and a half (the half being my friends unfinished slightly melted one.) But I digress! 

I am SO excited that this place is ""back."" It was formerly known as the Shiloh Inn and was closed for a couple months and taken over by the owners of the Harris Grill. It saddened me when the Shiloh Inn closed down because although I love me some Redbeards, this was the only place to have a nice sit down dinner on this side of the mount. 

Before, it kinda felt like a creepy old mansion rather than a hip restaurant. They've transformed it into a quaint and cozy little place! There was a warm !fireplace and it just felt very inviting inside, rather than the creepy before! I can't wait until they open up the deck outside because it's huge and a great place to sit and people watch in the summer! 

I was REALLY trying to be good and get a salad (even though it had french fries and a bucket o' ranch on it) but I thought I would be doing myself a disservice, being that it was my ""first time"" there. I caved and found the most delish sounding eggplant noodleless lasagna. Since I am a proud Italian, I HAVE to have my Italian dishes a certain way. That means lots of sauce and LOTS of cheese! This came out perfectly! I only wish I could make eggplant this well at home (hence going elsewhere to get it!) It was many many thin layers of breaded eggplant with lots of sauce and spinach in between. The spinach factor, in my mind, evened out the mounds of mozzarella cheese loaded on top.

They weren't kidding! I assume that maybe just meant a long wait for food.  It wasn't just food we waited for though!  We waited for drinks, bread an even silverware!  The server was no where to be found at times.

I would have forgiven all this if my food was amazing BUT it was far from it!  I'm very judgmental of Italian being that I am a proud Italian myself!  I ordered past vodka.  It was not the creamy delish sauce I expected, it was runny tastelessness!  My friend tried the regular spaghetti and the sauce tasted like it was from a spaghetti-o can.

All I know are that the drinks are cheap and the DJ is admittedly pretty awesome!  I've never eaten here before, but I can bet they have bar food.  I know, far stretched, right?

Funny thing is, this place is such a college-y hang out, but it's actually a really great place to grab food in Oakland.  Plus, the over 21 crowd can enjoy the great beer selections they have on tap here.  I LOVE places with a wide selections of beers on tap!  For some reason beer just tastes so.much.better out of a tap!

All the wood grilled selections are fantastic! For apps....3 words: Fire Baked Brie.  3 more words: TO DIE FOR!  I've also always been a fan of the individual pizza's and the Sierra Grilled Chicken Salad for the lighter side (of me!).  The sammie's are also very good.  I'm always into a good Portobello option, and the sandwich is fantastic with light balsamic drizzled on top.  

Annnnnnnd bargain time for poor hungry college students and people who still act like poor hungry college students (maybe me).  It's half price food after 11 PM.  I may not have went to school in Oakland, but we would stuff ourselves (literally sometimes 7 people) into one tiny car to have some late night bites.

Maybe I'll even eat here next time... stay tuned!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 4, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 2}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

But seriously, this guys are awesome!  I've heard one too many stories of people having horrible experiences with carpet cleaners.  I believe a lot of what I've heard have been from ill fated Groupon buys.  I've headed those warnings and proceeded with caution hiring cleaners.

What to do when no one on Yelp Pittsburgh has been reviewed yet?  Go with blind luck and hope for the best!  Thank god they turned out great!  They call you the night before to let you know when they'll be coming.  I assume it's easy for me since I have a flexible schedule, but I bet they'd be okay if you specified what time you'd need them to come.  

They called before they came, per my request.  I met two very friendly guys at the new house.  They did a walk through and estimate with me.  Their specialty is actually getting pet related stains, bacteria, smells, etc out.  Which is perfect considering the previous owners had cats and dogs and we want to bring our precious little kitties into a clean environment!  

I left, since it was an empty house, and not even an hour later they called to say they were almost finished.  They wanted me to come in right before they finished because they wanted me to see the difference.  Isn't that kinda cool?  

They worked and also talked to me about future carpet care and ways to remove stains efficiently.  They deep cleaned 106 sq ft for $300.  I know it sounds like a lot, but the carpets hadn't been cleaned in 15 years.  He said for a normal cleaning it would have been around $150.  Good thing is, my carpets looked amazing!  One of the rooms carpets I swear I thought was a dark cream color ended up being a brighter cream.  Who knew!  

*Accepts credit cards! 

I'd most definitely hire them again!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 7, u'cool': 1}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

I mean, maybe not wow me, but impress me enough to give them 4 stars to say; YAY! I'm a fan! So, I've been in a couple times... oh wait, did I say that already? Yeah... so....

It's okay. I had a Caesar salad that was hearty, with a good amount of dressing and peppery enough. But it was just okay. I tried the fried portobello strips another time, while they were good, again, they were just okay. 

Next time in, I had a soup and salad. Same Caesar salad, because again, it was a solid choice. I went for the seafood chowder, considering they're mainly a seafood joint. First off, I was expecting it to be the white New England clam chowder. Maybe I should have checked first, but it was the broth based New York chowder. Big chunks of fish, but it may have made it a little too fishy. Ya know what I mean? Again, it was okay. Nothing to rock my seafood loving world. 

You know what's funny? I'd give it one more try for the oysters. I love me some oysters as of late and have been looking for the right opportunity to pop in. So oyster lovers, chime in here! Any good? Am I wasting my time? I wanna hear!

Maybe this will joint will just end up being the only decent spot to have lunch meetings in Station Square.

There's a difference between a place that has one long table of buffet choices that's mass produced and more than likely been sitting out for most of the morning and the Grand Concourse.  The Grand Concourse is just that, GRAND!

The Grand Concourse may have that one long table of buffet foods that have possibly been touched by little kid sticky hands BUT they have ""create your own"" food stands!  Any place that offers me the chance to pile on the most scrumptious and fattening food toppings is a winner in my book!  Stop by the make your own omelet or pancake or waffle or ICE CREAM SUNDAE (can you tell how excited I am about that) bar for your own sinful creation.  

And the place itself....just breathtaking!  You don't come across many places like this anymore.  It used to be the main train station into downtown Pittsburgh and they've really done a fantastic job making it look as it did back in the day.  I swear to god I always want to act out the scene in the Titanic where they're all sitting around the main dining room together talking all proper.

Many moons ago, when I worked for Starbucks, I worked some shifts in the hotel.  I think I was convinced to pick up the shift on a promise that celebrities stay here when they're in town.  Sadly, no celebrities visited during my short shift.  Sniff, sniff.  But, it is nice to have a Starbucks conveniently located in your hotel for that morning pick me up!

I feel as if this hotel actually packs a lot of amenities in with all the stores and quick services it has right inside the actual hotel.  You can pick up a coffee at the Bucks, get your nails did at the salon or enjoy a pretty fabulous Sunday brunch all a few steps away from each other!

I'm a HUGE fan of high teas and they offer a pretty great high tea service Monday - Saturday 2:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m.  It includes a great selection of teas and of course freshly baked scones with clotted cream (YUM!), tea sandwiches and some little chocolates.  I would actually visit the hotel just for their tea service (hint: go for high tea sometime soon Pittsburghers!).

I've also been to a couple gala's in the grand hall.  It has an old feel to it, very elegant and classy in a way most modern ballrooms (like a Marriott or Sheraton) don't offer.  I would HIGHLY suggest these ballrooms if you're looking for that kind of theme for a gala or if you're planning a wedding.  

If you're ever up around the hotel, I encourage you to just take a peak around.  Maybe you'll be lucky enough to actually run into a celebrity!  Then I'll REALLY be jealous of you!!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 7, u'cool': 4}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

I'm really not a dive bar person.  I know, I know....it doesn't make sense!  I'm cheap, I love cheap drinks, and this is the mecca of cheap drink places.  I like to mix and mingle at bars, I like to drop it like it's hot.  If I dropped it like it's hot here I may get slapped.

I know this place is like thee dive bar spot in the Burgh, but I was just...meh.  I think the fact that smoking is still allowed makes a huge difference for me.  I go home smelling like an ash tray and yearning for a dance party.  

The only draw for me is the wide selection of beers and the DIRT CHEAP prices!  I just lean over the counter and stare at the huge beer refrigerator, scan my eyes over the bottles until the holy beer spirit hits me and I go....THAT ONE!  It's almost like my own personal beer tasting.

You can't beat this fun of an environment. Toss away the generic Hofbrauhaus get to a Pittsburgh legacy! I love the fun German beer hall feel with the large picnic size tables that just beckon you to sit down with an even larger brew!

I love German food, but there's a really good opportunity to screw it up. Have you ever noticed a lot of the colors of German food blend together? Sauerkraut, perogies, mashed taters (is that German? Whatever!), they all look the same! So making them taste good is a must! I'm a big fan of the perogies - a buttery delicious mixture in a lovely little dumpling. While I'm not really a fan of their sauerkraut, it's too sweet for me, I know some people like it that way (I like mine a little on the sour side). Throw in a pretzel with their beer cheese and some grilled kielbasa and I'm one happy German camper!

I'm a fan of their Penn Pilsner and a big big big fan of their special Chocolate Meltdown, which they debuted last Valentines Day. Now I'm telling you right now, you get yourself to Penn Brewery AS SOON as that comes out this year!

The other thing that's awesome about this place is that they throw a ton of events. Nevermind their month long Oktoberfest, they host bands every couple weeks that jam out inside and out. Speaking of which, they have a great outdoor courtyard for sitting with your fave brew!

In theory it sounds good. In real life I'll just drown any morsel of food I can into the chocolate and stuff it in! 

This is a special occasion restaurant. A special occasion where I have enough money to spare, because dear lord, it's pricey! 

The two greatest tips that they don't advertise: 

*Half off on Sundays from noon-3 PM. REMEMBER TO MENTION THIS TO YOUR SERVER! I learned that fact today when I got the shock of a full priced bill. I assumed they just took the discount off automatically, but apparently you have to tell your server as soon as you sit down that you want the half price meal. 

All Big Night Out meals half price = awesome deal! 

*Every day after 9 PM you can get cheese and chocolate fondue and a bottle of wine for $35. Serves two. 

The Big Night Out consists of your choice of cheese fondue (lots o' different choices of cheeses), salads (get the mushroom one), main dish (usually includes seafood and/or meat), veggies, potatoes and ravioli) and chocolate fondue (mmmmmm!!). 

You pick the type of broth for your main course. Usually there's one that complements meat and one for seafood. You're also able to mix and match your chocolate ingredients or choose one from the menu. I lurrrve the S'More's chocolate, it includes choco, marshmallow and graham cracker bits. And, ohhhhhh, the things you dip in the chocolate. Cheesecake, brownies, pound cake, rice crispies, marshmallows, banana's and strawberries. Seriously orgasmic!! 

They usually switch up the menu often so you can come once every couple of months and find something new. I also love the atmosphere. It's a great date night place or good for a group outing. The nice thing is that if you go with a group, you can choose a bunch of different cheeses, broths and chocolate to sneak a taste of all of them. 

Good thing for me that it is pricey. IF it was cheap, I don't think I'd like what the scale had to say after monthly visits to this place!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 4, u'cool': 0}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

I feel like people can legitmately say there's a difference between Tex Mex and authentic Mexican.  Is there really an authentic Chinese food?  Is General Tso a real person?  All these questions...irregardless....

I love this place!  I think the shrimp rolls deserve the highest rating with a nice crispy outside and crispy cabbage inside.  My go to meal choice of Sweet n' Sour chicken is always fab.  I love that they put enough sauce on (which is a lot, so beware if you don't like a lot) that I can mix it up in my oh so healthy white rice...cough cough.  And I LOVE that they give you free tea and it's good!  I never use sweetener.  It's some sort of Jasmine blend and I always enjoy going with people that don't drink a lot because I usually drink it all!

And for realz, how do you beat the Lunch Special?  A choice of Egg Roll or soup: fried rice, steamed rice or brown rice and tea for $7.50.  Bam, full until....2...hours....later....But that's the joy of Chinese.  And boy did it taste good going down!

Fish Sammie, potato pancakes, cole slaw and a fountain drink.  The fish sandwich was perfection.  Came out nice and hot, like fresh and hot that it burnt my tongue in my excitement to eat it!  There were two generous pieces of fried fish between a fresh bun.  After my order, I heard someone order a wheat bun, so that's a good thing to know for future visits.  I'm very judgmental with my cole slaw... So I'd say it needed a bit more pepper, but it was a decent vinegar based slaw.  The potato pancakes were like mini home fry circles.  They were also fresh out of the fryer.  Speaking of fry... that's not going to go down as my healthiest meal... But it was darn good!

The main difference I see here compared to Wholey's is that it doesn't reek of fish.  Wholey's is kinda gross.  This place is incredibly clean and well laid out.  You can order fresh fish as well as a plethora of different fresh salads (pasta, fish, chicken, potato, etc.) and sides.  It's definitely beat out Wholey's in my opinion.

It's way bigger than I thought it would be. A little lonely feeling for a lunchtime. Out of so many sandwiches it was hard to choose, but I went for the Reuben. I'd say they're a tricky beast to tackle. It was okay. Not the best I've ever had, but certainly not the worst. I like mine loaded with sauerkraut, and this just had a decent size for someone who likes an even distribution. But not me, load it on! I was a little bummed the bread was a bit soggy. That's the worst, right?

I asked the dude for a suggestion on a side and he said try the coleslaw because he doesn't like mayo. But when it came out, there was no question, it was a mayo based slaw. I love mayo, so that was fine. Not bad again. Just okay.

I think this bar would be my jam if I lived on the North Side. TONS of beer on tap that I'd for sure want to tap into! Maybe I'll treat myself to a happy hour there...

You'd be lucky to have them as a bestie because your teeth would always look amazing!  It doesn't matter, because now that I've found my new dentist (THANKS Yelp and Alex W), I will have pretty teeth as well.  

The dentist was never a scary thing for me, I just got out of the habit of going.  My teeth felt gross and I got ashamed... So I kept pushing it off.  I spent enough time being lazy and having dirty teeth, so I turned to Yelp.

As soon as you walk into the office you're greeted by the nicest man ever.  I believe he must be the assistant.  He greeted me and thanked me for coming even before I had my check-up.  It's in a beautiful victorian house on the North Side, but all the equipment is state of the art.  

Dr. Dan was thorough, but I was mostly entertained by his colorful commentary on the Food Network and how much he loves chef Lidia.  He also brought out his ADORABLE new puppy for me to see.  SERIOUSLY, I wanted a lifetime supply of toothbrushes and this puppy!  

I thought it was neat because he put my x-rays up on the TV for me to see and described what he saw (no cavities, whoop whoop!).

It's really awesome to be able to walk into a room with tons of colorful and interesting looking of birds flying around you.  I must admit, I did have to duck and run a couple of times for fear of getting pooped on!  But thankfully there were no close calls.

They used to schedule a welcome back party on the boat every year in August our first week in school.  The first time seeing the city from the river was so magical for me!  I think that's when I feel in love with it.  Seriously, you can get the view from the highway, the tall buildings or even Mt. Washington, but this is a totally different perspective.  One you can get to by yourself.  I just love it!

I looked forward to that time on the boat every year!  It even put so much of an impression on me that I considered it for my wedding.  Ultimately we decided to have our wedding in Erie, but if we would have had it in Pittsburgh, it would have been my first choice.  It's just such a unique way to experience the city!  

They usually sail a good way along each of the rivers so you get to take in every last part of the city.  I love being able to float past all the main hot spots of the city, especially the Point and the Stadiums.  And you can't beat that cool summer breeze coming from the top of the boat. 

I love that they offer a slew of different cruises, from the family ice cream sundays to the dinner and dancing cruises and everything in between, they pack that schedule full!

While I do think it was pretty expensive, I did buy perennials for my whole front facing garden. So now I won't have to bother with it again.

But seriously, let's get to the important part.  FREE Wifi!!!  Do I need to say anymore about that?

The other important part, the food choices.  I hate when the only thing offered in an airport is fast food options or sit down restaurants.  I want a nice balance that's fast and not fried.  There weren't many of those choices, unless you wanted to grab a pre-made sandwich from one of those corner grab and go stations.  Meh.  Good thing was you can scrounge up something and at least there are options.  I've been to some airports were there's hardly anything in the terminal you're parking it at for 2 plus hours.  Thee worst!

Another plus, it's literally minutes from The Strip.  Being from a city (Pittsburgh) that has an airport more than 20 minutes outside the city limits, that's a big plus!

588	BacrktTHhhr_LRXCJY_S-w	2011-04-27	tOqNcmDyp6EU8b-LiMcbjQ	4	"True Story:  I went to Kennywood, got Potato Patch fries and left.  No lie! 

I would have never done this if it wasn't for a couple factors.  One the fact that I had free tickets (hello, I'm cheap!) and Two being that it was CRAZY busy!  Like I had never seen it this busy ever!  I guess it was High School Band Night.  Please, for the love of God, find out when it is every year and NEVER go then!  It was swarming with smelly teens! 

So obviously Potato Patch fries can justify a long trip here! 

Seriously though, it's really worth the trip and usually total traffic hassle (seriously, at least one bridge over to the park is closed every year!) to come here once or maybe twice a year!  I love the old amusement park feel.  You definitely don't get that from Cedar Point or a Six Flags. 

The good things to take away from those major parks is the major rides.  Kennywood has that in the Phantom's Revenge!  I LOVE me some roller coasters and this one is at the top of my list!  This is major, so listen up!  You go slooooowly up the first hill and whip down the first hill and up to the second one and you shoot down the second hill into a ravine and it's a MEGA drop.  It's so so so much fun! 

They also have a couple wooden roller coasters, my fav being the Thunderbolt.  It's one of those classic ones that just jumps and whips you all around.  Really, any ride that flings me around I'm into!  Which brings me to my favorite spinny, make you maybe want to throw up in a good way ride....the Aero 360!!  It swings you around 360 degrees (dah) and holds you suspended upside down for a couple seconds, every couple swings.  It's fantastic, but not for the weak stomachs out there! 

I have to admit, I do have to go back and try the new Sky Coaster. Every time I tried to ride it the line was LOOOOONG.  I'm sorta impatient, especially when it's sweltering out, so that one was skipped last year.

So lets set the scene.  I'm waiting at the host stand and watching as people that looked as if they worked there whizz by. No acknowledgment, no ""hey, we'll be with you in a sec."" Nothing, nada, zip. About 15 minutes went by ...FINALLY, someone came up and sat us. So not a good way to start an eating and beerfest 

Annnnd then our ""less than interested in anything remotely serving related"" server came up to us after about 10 minutes. I asked about the lager choices and he muttered something about not having any lager choices. No lager choices at a beer emporium? Say what!? Liar! 

I ended up choosing a beer he mumbled about that was a carmel something something beer. I wish I could have heard what the name was, but there was no way I was going to actually talk with our server. Boo! 

Our order took forever to come out, even though everyone ordered sandwiches. I was so ravished and probably a little buzzed by the time my food came that I inhaled it! I remember it being pretty good though, so that was the one plus! Chicken and Cranberry Salad Sandwich is a good choice!! The one thing that's funny is that when you have bad service, the check always magically appears, and FAST! 

So I'd say in the great debate, even if the food is really good, what you remember at the end is the craptacular service and not the amazing food.

Even if you're not a devote Andy Warhol fan you'll find something interesting and different to see.  They always offer special exhibits that stay for a couple months and then they have the mainstays that you'll be sure to recognize.  The most memorable room at the Warhol has to be the silver clouds room.  That's all I'll say, because you HAVE to check it out!

They've remodeled the museum so that you start at the top with Andy's earlier years and work down through his life and career. I don't know if somehow I missed it before, but I'd never seen many of the pictures and facts of his very early life and family growing up in Pittsburgh. It was so cool to see him as a child and learn about his whole family. I truly loved reading about how much his parents supported his artist talents.

I also loved seeing more of his earlier works, when he was doing retail ads. I know I remember seeing some of this before at the museum, but maybe it wasn't as clearly marked and displayed as it is now.

Of course there's still the classics, like the silver cloud room and the screen printed works that are a must see. I LOVE the new lobby with the silver colors and replica of the couch from his Factory days. Great photo opp!

I like that the cafe is upstairs now, although it seems that they've cut down on options? But the gift shop is amazing! So much larger, with even more quirky selections. I'd come here just for the gift shop to buy a gift (or a little something for myself!). 

If you're visiting Pittsburgh this museum is a MUST. Although it is not for the faint of heart. Keep in mind there is some not so G rated materials aka I once checked out a very scandalous special exhibit here!

I'm not talking about your drunk friend wobbling over to hand you a plate of food out of her kitchen. Or the bartender who's drinking along with you. I'm talking about an actual server at a restaurant...for lunch. 

If I didn't find it so amusing I would have been SO irritated. Thankfully, it's just one of those times you're just a spectator in a funny comedy of errors. I've been served by this woman before, and it seems that she may be an owner or manager. Someone who's obviously able to imbibe on the wine during work hours. Oh, and she was definitely tipsy last time...this time....it was party time drunk! 

So Drunky McDrunkster kept forgetting to bring us our drinks, our water and our bread. She also messed up our orders by forgetting what they were and then running back to find out what we had asked for. Then our orders came and both my friends ""sangaweeches"" where wrong. They were gracious enough to just eat them and not care. They agreed that they weren't bad, but they weren't t life changing either. Everyone wants a life changing meal! 

I've been here once before for lunch as well and wasn't too impressed. I got the pasta vodka the first time and it was ok. Not mind blowing...obviously how I like my pasta to be! 

This time I just ordered an anti pasta salad. I thought it was an interesting twist to add dried cranberries and walnuts with absolutely no cheese (boo!). The bread was actually really delish! That was probably my favorite part...well...other than the drunk server. 

The really surprising part about McDrunkster is that the wine they sell is NOT good. They've started to make their own and it just tasted as if the ingredients didn't mesh like they should. I've meet a couple wine's I don't particularly like, but I've never meet a wine I can't even stand to sip. I'll take my cheap Yellow Tail if that's the case! 

So more power to you lady, if you can enjoy your job, with a bottle of wine included daily. I just don't think I'll be back to eat. Maybe just spectate!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 6, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 2}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

But the wait wasn't too too bad, even if it was out in the cold for about 15 minutes. Totally worth it once you're warm inside and a hot plate of breakfast food is staring at you!

I'm going to do the thing you shouldn't do but everyone does, compare it to Pamela's. I mean, it's one of the most popular breakfast spots in Pittsburgh, how can I not!? And happily I'd say it was totally on par. Would I say it's better? Probably the same, but for different reasons. 

They looked to have a bigger menu than Pamela's, serving hotcakes (what Pamela's is famous for) and regular pancakes. Although I'm a huge pancake fan and most of the options looked amazing, I really wanted a regular down home eggs, homefires, sausage and toast breakfast.

And with an expanded menu they have so many choices beyond the menu! When I asked for sausage she was like, patty, turkey, hot, veggie... the list went on! I had to hear them twice! My homefries were good, I added onion and pepper to the mix, I just wish they would have been a tad crispier. 

The place really does have it's own identity, with the red vinyl booths and memorabilia on the walls.

You need to go here for a couple different reasons. Number one: the food is Caribbean amazingness. Number two: the Happy Hour specials are a great deal, half off most all drinks, including beers, wines and mixed drinks. You really can't beat that! Number three: it's like you're on an island mon, so lots of funky art and furniture. The bar stools are little palm trees!

They have a great selection of South American wines and beers. They change up the beers to offer tasty seasonal brews on tap, so you're able to try new things pretty often. The food is also incredible! My favorites are the fish taco's, which has this delicious slaw mixture inside. Also, the jerk chicken wings along with a cilantro dipping sauce is mouth watering. I love this sauce and always get a side of sweet potato fries to dip into the sauce! And the sweet potato fries! Oh.my.gawd! So good! 

So if you're in the Strip it's right off the beaten path on Smallman St. and 20th. It's worth it for lunch, dinner, happy hour and even brunch on Sundays. Go! Go!

You're pretty sure you're still going to like them, but something could go terribly wrong and you'll be disappointed at the hope of a long lasting relationship. 

Kaya is my go to joint for happy hour. Hands down they have thee best happy hour in the city. I mean, half off EVERYTHING! Even shots (okay, things get a little crazy when you enter that into the equation). And, of course, if you're drinking it up you also have to get some nourishment. Coming here so much, I've gone down the menu with my meals and not-a-one has let me down! All amazing... Big shout out to the Fish Tacos.

I'd heard how good brunch was, but I really wanted it to live up to the normal Kaya standard. You can see why I'd be nervous. If they ruined something as sacred as brunch, what would be left? Maybe I'm being too dramatic, because you know I'd be back at that bar once it hit 5pm, but still... I was expecting a stellar meal. 

I'm happy to report, they delivered, and then some! There were a handful of items that stood out to me, but the Salmon Eggs Benedict was the true winner. I believe the key item being corn bread instead of a biscuit. LOVED. IT. Every bite. The cornbread made the dish, but the hollandaise was a close second (you can't mess with a good sauce!). Eggs were perfect and salmon was smokey. The side dishes held their own with juicy sweet sauteed pineapples and a spicy potato hash. I really wanted to lick my plate clean. 

They can do no wrong in my book. Come for brunch, stay for lunch and exit after dinner. You'll probably want to throw up after a full day spent eating and drinking at Kaya, but it will have been worth it, I swear!"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 4, u'useful': 7, u'cool': 7}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

But not only will you find fresh fish here, but you'll also find really cheap fresh produce too!  I feel like that's a little known fact.  It may be a challenge if you're just going for the cheap produce and can't stand the smell of fish though...so bring the nose plugs.  

I love coming here in the summer when I want to grill out.  I stop in for the fresh tuna steak and shrimp.  This is the place to go to get big portions and half the cost of Giant Eagle, and you know it's going to be good and worth it!  

On the off months it's nice to come in to grab a nice fishy lunch (hello fish sammie!) or stop in for sushi at Andy's Sushi Bar (see Andy's Sushi Bar review!).  Seriously, if you're a fish lover, you really must come in here!  You'll obviously be okay with the fish smell then...non-fish lovers beware.

I was between a burger and the tuna melt. All the burgers looked really good, but I thought I'd go with something a little lighter. Um, lighter was not happening though, as I later found out! My plate came with a HUGE helping of tuna in between two slightly too small white pieces of bread and a massive mound of waffle fries. The tuna was okay, if not a little bland. There was cheese on the sandwich, I think, but I couldn't taste it with the mound of tuna that they plopped in between.

The Venetian isn't the most expensive on the strip, it's not the cheapest either, so I appreciated the nice rooms. I've stayed at the Aria and Planet Hollywood (and one random awful time share property) this was probably the nicest. 

I loved having the living room set up with a large sectional, I did find a random frito in it, but I digress. It wasn't a dirty room. I loved the bathroom! Super spacious, stand up shower AND jacuzzi, which I thoroughly enjoyed one day. Plus, extra bonus points for the make-up table and mirror. Plus a separate room for the toilet. 

The good thing about staying in the ""older"" tower is you're an elevator ride away from the casino. Can I rate the casino? Eh, I'm not much of a gambler. But I did enjoy the coffee stand right outside the elevators and the gelato stand by the back entrance.

I experienced the pool only for an hour one day because we were here in November and I thought it was just too chilly to take a dip. But, the good thing is it's a heated pool! Tons of seating and room in the pool. Plus a large bar outside.

The one negative is that I found it to be on the farther end of the Strip. While I thought it was a nice place, I probably wouldn't stay here again because of that. I like to be in the middle of everything. But it wasn't as far as say, the Wynn. Which is WAY too far for me."	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 4, u'cool': 2}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

You get the point... it was cheap. My girlfriend booked it for her bachelorette party and we were splitting it between 8 people. For 3 nights we paid around $130. Cheap, I know. But was the cheapness worth it? I guess I'm trying to figure that out...

The rooms weren't bad by any means. It was clean. It was nice to have a kitchenette. Especially the full size fridge, which held a lot of... drinks cold. I wish there was an option to get two double beds instead of a king bed with sofa pull out, but the pull out, which I slept on, wasn't too uncomfortable. 

But the catch? It's ""connected"" to the Cosmo. But to get to the Cosmo you literally have to go to an elevator, across a hallway, to another elevator, across the hallway to another elevator, through the laundry room... okay, I'm lying about that last part, but you get it, right? It's confusing. And far. We basically gave up and went out the main entrance of the Jockey Club and walked around to the main entrance of the Cosmo.

We were also under the impression that we had access to all three of Cosmo pools. You do not. You only have access to the pool on the 14th floor. That pool is also up an elevator, through a hallway, down a longer hallway and up another elevator. It's far. And the pool is small and overcrowded. There were absolutely no chairs available when we arrived at 10am (early for Vegas standards!). The pool food menu is also incredibly limited, with not even a nacho platter on it! I'll admit, the gauc and chips were okay, but just okay. There is a small pool at the Jockey Club, but let's be honest, it was boring. No music, no food and NO sunlight. What's the point??

Would I stay here again? No. I'd pay a little more to be in a normal hotel. But to be clear, it was not dirty or uncomfortable. Just inconvenient. And I'm not a gambler, so the pool is really important to me. I was not into the pool choice. To me, the best pool in Vegas of the three places I've stayed, Planet Hollywood and Aria, Aria was the best by far. Oh yeah, I may have snuck into the Bellagio pool too, and that was nice, but very laid back (aka older crowd). Why go to Vegas and not break the rules a little, right?"	review	nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ	{u'funny': 9, u'useful': 10, u'cool': 8}	3.84	{u'profile': 16, u'funny': 276, u'cute': 24, u'plain': 1965, u'writer': 249, u'list': 13, u'note': 598, u'photos': 52, u'hot': 335, u'more': 42, u'cool': 711}	[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	261	[rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA, nGV0YhaDoFP4JNHKfmut4g, pW91HUnVz6ssLZ4dY-ztyQ, LroJKi7_BWqDT7lbHvt6kg, gJHXnTJ65f1cfPhU3M1GVw, ARe8Nr_YehB2ubsGJhZ-hg, YKppbE7ogNmbtVrluxEF4A, Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ, -2RVxn8RRN3j9bOiqGkjug, MuIQ8Rm2ZrERGE9mtxqGqw, sleEMt44E1StWrjz3mcujQ, _e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg, 7fOMeE-emdNuPYoSHxD-Gw, n39GzHIhRAOPDBWg5LKjSQ, J3rNWRLRuZJ_0xsJalIhlA, 94N07GeXPUyC8baIz0l3UA, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, urwdAGFLyb2qtB0m9abpHg, vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g, 9LUZil3kYErxhH4fQyfZzA, oiyCfSHLvdj0d1fPMnz2Rw, ChPpkHTyL3CyajLIuUrgjg, yyvwMoMifs1p1cp9B68XIQ, hzaqnSxfRYv_Wbp6CMKtQw, qnnieCU8EXZyojWuKg1iVQ, 5h_P5sVbGxtw9ldH4sWZkw, q8Xf1-A3iQJ8F-3mJFOXOQ, n4QTIJq0uXVcEls_No9DyQ, UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ, 33lGHHGU5t6Fah8G-dU0zg, X2PZFXY6v94mxfmvc1TImg, F9T6m1YdRFreyKDufcyoOQ, r5vDrlFu45VK6kW4vyuvMg, 5eBYTs1PL2lPy-ng6co5yA, EFg-ew3x8j2XPJn4e5t45g, eovwN_EDnxVc4UZgYJId2w, WME6ZEvbiOwuMm3JqG5o8w, qdyZ-Iy4ztJ_DB5znAu0Qw, dpYyldAl7bVIXCcCM-c5JA, _1mBBkphbaKO3EQHnpBQJA, z5Y8aIWjwyaa0110WAZorg, q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, WmAyExqSWoiYZ5XEqpk_Uw, RykUrBlD01fht38BTfNMEQ, L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g, nELVJlkX8T0mUAArSPSJxw, mFOZOsPQOacWIMVSyXbEbg, u2lanPBcORxbwJzsEbAExg, lTR9GsUJ8iJqH6yh-51cmg, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, NjIjQMKAqBUE1Nw0QgsP1Q, 8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg, pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA, qnN_39P0_9d5PB21Q3gDOQ, B4KTa9To2jrqr-NK7c7kwA, fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw, WeX6UjZSTeMfFBQGDfu1jw, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, IbvOxKSps_K5wa3a2_jc-Q, B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, KhylJYQqoKzDGmFabiAQUg, QDirgB3cwUUp6dI6SIeydA, Wx9gwt571tHITuWs144fLA, Qm9cNZaplHW8n_0xiDdC8A, lLZfboZB3B0LquJNR6GmkA, 8GccAq9PTpIWlp0gnCHoRQ, Wj_qVEYRdQiRNyskyRGSCg, fu-sgTJoBBgqqeEIcTzRhA, yVyOedgM0Eb-KBU63k9fvA, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, _A_2A-bjADJTKBoWd_B5qg, XXxNRoSgV67mY-34p3OphA, mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g, 7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww, cVoLtThi7TivfnHqdDWXzw, dS02pxg9FMgcJoQEohsMCA, VESaDn1MpEIAC7C-SvGO2w, Hv-U6M-gVXf8jqzgWbYLXA, ia0TVNiDfy7QX-5BECyw8Q, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg, Io6At5jerTw_PpWj1hYXeA, TckShYnQa0eD3WQxdoE3GQ, dmsl6Oo6w-J9ZhJ92kt3Fg, b7fqzVSUr3Ih7LQfgbosaw, Oia5vauz_LUfvx5VWKd-Dw, bmXuGmfu9LahwRMLjs5OXA, 2PwXZjHOoWT9D5u6VbACNg, iNPhLi-GsAgecwZHCM1_bA, 3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ, KryEmNBWRYYf2tWsgKIKpg, Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, VoY_uTS59Xjntzet1STwQA, ...]	Rachel	966	user	{u'funny': 2471, u'useful': 6132, u'cool': 3440}	2011-01

We went into the exam room with doctor Tierney Kelley and a vet asst Sam. They were the best. So gentle and caring. They did not pressure us into any procedures that my cat did not need. They worked hard So we didn't have to leave him over night. This was by far the best veterinarian I have gone to in all my years as a pet owner. This has all become a racket for making money. Doctors don't care about the animals in 90% of the places you go, but Greetree animal clinic is not one of those places.

I have worked as a vet tech in a previous job and have had experiences at numerous facilities here in Pittsburgh and Greentree Animal Clinic blows them all out of the water. Key things that you should note about this place:
* They do not over charge
* They only recommend services/things that they genuinely believe will help your pet, not their bottom line and they do not pressure you in any way
* They are respectful and genuine to you and your pet which is hard to come by nowadays
* Everyone from the front desk to the techs, to the vets are kind, patient and understanding. No condescension or poor attitudes, just positive vibes all around. 
* Dr Brown goes above and beyond any vet I've ever met. He has shown so much care, professionalism,  kindness and knowledge that I will gladly refer anyone with a pet to him because I know they will be in good hands and his fellow vets (Dr Reuther, Dr Kelley, and Dr Mann)  are just as phenomenal.

I like to stretch out before my class actually starts, so I went to the tail end of a yoga class. The women in this class were very nasty to me and told me that I wasn't welcome to stretch out in their class. I never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members.

We went on a tuesday in the summer and it wasnt too crowded. If u hate crowds and screaming toddlers like i do. Go on a weekday when it opens. I noticed it got more crowded later in the afternoon. I paid to park across the street. It was $6 but i am sure u could find cheaper if ur willing to walk further and using parking meter. It was 90 degrees out so we opted to pay to be 1/4 block away. The parking situation is bad when there is a baseball game at PNC park.

I have Triple A in case I get a flat, because I have no idea where my jack is. I took my present car back to the dealership the day after driving it off the lot to have them show me how to turn on my hazard signal, also, to show me how to release the parking brakes, and how to turn on the rear defoggers. Yes, the owners manual was in the glove box, but there was way too much reading involved, and I learn quicker by hands on training.

Advanced Auto is a God send for me, when I needed windshield wipers, the ones on the car sounded like a cow being skinned alive each time I turned them on. So, I didn't use them often, which isn't good in a driving rain storm. I walked in and went up to an associate and asked him where the wipers were. Not only did he get me the wipers, he saved me a ton of embarrassment by putting them on for me at no extra charge. I gave him a nice tip which he refused, but I insisted. I also picked up a nice leather steering wheel cover (proud to say I figured out how to put that on without a mechanic!) and a gas additive to clean out my fuel system.

I want Yelpers from all across this great land to read this review and think to themselves ""I wish I could write a review like this one."" This review must be honest, to the point, be the subject of debates and casual comversation. It should be humorous too, not so humorous that it loses it's methodology. It should make you want to go to this establishment and see it for yourself. When you get here, you fall to you knees and scream ""It truely is indeed a Mecca"" 

This review must compel Yelpers from all over the world to come to Pittsburgh to see this attraction that I have  written about. I want people from India, Canada, Mexico, Italy, Germany, France, and even the little countries like Wyoming and Pluto to gather here and praise me to the highest, seat me at right hand of you know who, and sing me the Ava Maria and Bett Midler's version of The Boogie Woogie Bugal Boy.

Once I leave this big blue marble, I want people to remember me as the man who wrote the greatest Yelp review ever. People will bring children to my grave and say to them ""you should read his review, for it was the most honest, thoughtful, and heartfelt review ever written. Flawless, it flows like a gentle brook on a spring day."" My reviews will be the subject of future thesises, lectures, and studied by philosophers.

And now, without further adeu, my greatest review...

Then when the chain restaurant magnet ""waterfront"" opened in 2000 the parent company of The Rock Bottom Breweries decided to open Sing Sing in back of The Brewery.

When it first opened it was pretty cool. The very first house band could put on a show that led to standing ovations. I know, I was there. From Stairway to Heaven to Free Bird, Stayin' Alive to She's My Cherry Pie, Elton John to the Boss, they were amazing at sounding like the bands they were covering. Equally incredible were the obscure songs that audience members would shout out, songs only you though you knew, and they would effortlessly sing a good portion of the song, sounding like the band who's song they sung.

Next, the food. Just like all the chain places at the Waterfront, there are sandwiches, burgers (yes they have a blue cheese burger, who doesn't?) pasta, salads, chicken fingers, yadda yadda. 

The games, I swear over three quarters of the games have been there since 2000 when the place opened. I guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene.

The beers are always good and the Uppity Jagoff IPA is one of the best India Pale Ales I've ever tasted. The low point lately has been the food. I will never forgive the idiot in management who took the chicken quesadilla off the menu. That said, I ordered the lobster roll and when it arrived, the bread was as hard as a brick and cold. The filling was okay, but the lobster flavor was masked by over spicing. I suggest you eat somewhere else and imbibe at the Rock Bottom.	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 1}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

Hint: eat elsewhere, the food isn't so great, have an appetizer until you get to another restaurant, most comedians head over to the Rock Bottom after to imbibe.

I guess this particular restaurant benefits from people who work at the Waterfront stopping in after a shift. It's always packed. Being so close to the AMC theater, they get traffic before and after movies. 

It's expensive, the food is so so. Before I get ahead of myself, I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad without chicken. The BBQ ranch dressing was very good, but it's very easy to duplicate at home. It's equal parts ranch dressing and KC Masterpiece hickory BBQ sauce and a drop or two of Worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce. 

Tuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight, daily drink and happy hour selections, but even that's not enough to get me here. Skip it. One caveat for this location, free parking. At Station Square's location you gotta pay to park the jalopy.

Vegan friend Deb (VFD) asked the waitress if they could prepare a version of the famous chicken and lettuce wraps. The waitress without hesitation proclaimed they always had a vegan version, but it was never put on the menu.
Warning: even though it's vegan, it still contains the same amount of salt that was reported on all the news channels when the salt, fat, and cholesterol police made the sodium content available to the public. The vegan version is just as delicious and the chicken.

We were both eating lite since a) I was dieting and b) my family was having dinner at my mother's house and she was slaving over lasagna all day, so if anyone knows anything about Italian mother's, you better arrive hungry. Back to mitchell's, I had the iceberg wedge with bacon, egg, tomatoes and a delicious home made blue cheese dressing. I also ordered a bowl of seafood gumbo which was the best gumbo I ever tasted. It wasn't overly packed with rice, as a matter of fact, there wasn't much rice at all. It was mostly shredded crab, scallops, and shrimp with a very delicate broth that wasn't too thick and the heat snuck up on you after swallowing. It wasn't a lot of heat, just enough to make it exciting. As for the iceberg wedge salad, every once in awhile I need a piece of iceberg instead of a bowl of spring mix (ie: tender weeds). The star of this salad was the chef made blue cheese dressing. It was not overly thick, very tasty and savory. It complimented the bacon and egg on the wedge. The cousin ordered the carrot cake for dessert and it was easily a pound slice. I tasted a little bite and must say it's the best carrot cake I've ever tasted. The cream cheese frosting was more buttery than ""cheesy"", it was a great surprise when you're expecting the normal cream cheese frosting. There were whole walnuts throughout the cake and many raisins, which I love. Also this recipe seems to rely on more cinnamon than I've tasted in the past. I highly recommend it. It was a wonderful lunch and I'm sure she had carrot cake to take on the plane ride back to Riverside."	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

Unfortunately on this day we arrived after the kitchen closed, but the friendly barista behind the counter offered to make us a drink. I had a soy green tea latte, he chose a dirty chai latte, made with coffee and tea, interesting!

My green tea latte was served piping hot in a pint glass, not the Shamrock shake colored green tea latte you get at Starbucks, this was the color of your father's old white shirt that hasn't been washed in a few weeks. Not as syrupy sweet as Starbucks either, but a nice dose of natural brown sugar gave it a nice taste. And it was a nickel cheaper than a Starbucks ""tall"". Good deal!

My friend Jamie's dirty chai latte was good, again not overly sweet, which is ok for him, he doesn't have a sweet tooth. 

Next Sunday we'll go back earlier when the kitchen is open, the take out menu looks great, healthy, low fat, and vegan."	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 1}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

First, it's not bad, for what it is. I like trader Joe's better, I like whole foods better, but this place had stuff I use that the other don't.

Nice produce section, items seemed fresh, and plentiful. Mostly organic, and I do like how they label things ""local"" so that we can help our local farmers, and growers. 

Great juice bar, salad bar, and hot lunch items. Everything looked appetizing.

Great spice and herb section, I bought some freshly ground ginger and some wonderful sweet and smoked paprikas. 

Good vegan section, tofurkey brands and lightlife products. Good dairy section too, their prices for soy milk is a bit outrageous.

647	qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g	2010-08-16	mEaPO68yjqeWgFi3QVF7eg	5	My cousin took me here for my birthday, It's in a bad neighborhood, almost a war zone, but the food is out of this world. We sat down to a bowl of garbanzo bean salad done simply with herbs, spices, and olive oil, simple but delicious! A basket of bread soon arrived with an olive oil dipping bowl. We split the half pound meatball that was only second to mom's great meatballs. Salad was good after the appetizer, I had the home made blue cheese dressing. The pasta course was rotini with vodka sauce, best vodka sauce I've ever had. The main course was amazing, I had the pork cutlet Parmesan. The pork melted in your mouth, the sauce was excellent, the cheese had a sharp bite and a drizzle of truffle oil made it all come together. Be prepared to sit for two hours for the entire meal. Large TVs in the upstairs dining room show the Godfather movies without the sound, we were surprised the pretty gruesome scenes were shown while trying to eat. Great place, the bill was close to a buck and a half. It's pricey but worth the splurge.	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

I started out with the twelve ounce stuffed meatball and the truffled mushroom appetizers. The waiter invited me to watch as the mushrooms were being prepared at the kitchen counter. There I chatted with the chef as he prepared my app. Explaining as he went on, first slicing fresh chantrel, portobellos, and button mushrooms. Next he sauté them in olive oil, added brown sugar, brandy, raisins, and finished it with heavy cream. They were fantastic. There were a variety of specials including wild boar chops, a risotto with prawns, scallops, and black truffles. But I chose the dry aged filet with lump crab in a leek cream. It was the best piece of filet I've ever had. It was easily a pound of beef and a half pound of crab in a light cream sauce with leeks. I could barely touch it after the pasta, salad, bread, and appetizers. I brought my leftovers home and have them another time. Dessert consisted of a nice portion of carrot cake with an apricot cream cheese icing with apricot jam filling. It was a nice take on an old favorite. For the four of us the bill was over 300 dollars, but well worth it for the attentive service and extremely well prepared food.	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 5, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08
649	hBAcj7X5JHeX2hvmptwH-w	2015-06-04	36A-FAQzk_lmetSRSrJWAw	3	"Inside the old St. Mary's Priory, a beautiful hotel transformed from a real monastery is Monk's Bar. The tiny and I mean very small bar, with three tiny tables and three bar stools is big on properly made drinks. 

I sat at a stool which isn't high enough for the bar which made for a rather uncomfortable seating. My friend Katrina has known the lone bartender, Nikki for years and has been wanting to get me out of my comfort zone and try new places. I beat Katrina to the Priory and found a lot of free parking out front (after 7 pm street parking is free) and went inside. 

Now situated, I sat down and looked over the menu and decided on a Monktini, citron absolute, fresh lime juice and razzmatazz. Perfect for a warm summer night, not heavy or filling, a little sweet, a little tart. Refreshing! After Katrina arrived another couple walked in and sat at one of the small cafe tables, the tiny room induces conversation with others, especially when the bartender introduces you to everyone. 

Time for a bite and this is where Monk's Bar lost a star (the uncomfortably high bar and low stools cost them a star as well) but as a practicing vegan, there were no options I could enjoy. Sandwiches are served on pretzel buns (monks invented pretzels) with options like a ham and turkey club, turkey, creamy chicken salad, and a few others I forgot. I did order hummus but it wasn't filling at all. I did enjoy the house made Lemoncello, although I have made this in the past, Monk's makes there's with grain alcohol which I found to be too strong.

Dear Warren Buffett, don't mess with my ketchup!

FACT: Heinz Ketchup is used in 93% of restaurants, nation wide!

The HJ Heinz company was formed in 1869 when Henry John Heinz sold his mother's canned horseradish door to door. 

Today Heinz's headquarters are still here in Pittsburgh, although no products are made in Pittsburgh anymore. The plant at the base of Troy Hill near the Allegheny river was sold to Treehouse Foods where they make private label soups. I'll never forget going to the factory as a Cub Scout and how the vinegar smelled as we toured the factory. We each got a full size bottle of Ketchup to take home with us, and of course a Pickle Pin, one of the most iconic symbols associated with Heinz.

Again, Mr Buffett, don't mess with the red stuff or a whole gaggle of Terrible Towel waving Yinzers will open a can of whoop ass on ya!"	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 4}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

654	5GS5sBSscgcex0IFTDL9Bg	2012-02-24	0IGtWeYQ9rJZNM7c7jZ-Bg	5	"Without a doubt the Pittsburgh Steelers are one of the greatest and most respected teams in the National Football League.

Founded in 1933 by Arthur J. Rooney, they were known as the Pittsburgh Pirates, later, given their own identity and renamed the ""Steelers"" in honor of Pittsburgh's steel industry. 

The first thirty-nine years were not kind to Art Rooney and the city of Pittsburgh, the Steelers could never put a winning season together, until, finally in 1972 Chuck Noll guided the team to their first divisional crown and playoff victory. It was on December 31st that perhaps the greatest play in NFL history took place when the ""Immaculate Reception"" propelled the Steelers to a victory over the Oakland Raiders. Instantly the city became a football town, with the Steelers winning four Super Bowls in six seasons.

No team has more Super Bowl victories (6) than the Steelers. Also, Chuck Noll is the winningest coach with four Super Bowl crowns. Bill Cower and present head coach Mike Tomlin also have Super Bowl victories. 

Notable Steelers in the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Lynn Swann, Jack Lambert, Jack Ham, ""Mean"" Joe Greene, Terry Bradshaw, founder Art ""The Chief"" Rooney, Chuck Noll, Mike Webster, Dan Rooney, Franco Harris, and many more. Steeler fans want the Hall of Fame to open a Steeler's wing to accommodate all of the players in the hall and future Hall of Famers.

The Steelers have had four homes, Pitt Stadium, Forbes Field, Three Rivers Stadium and Heinz Field."	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 1}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

What a thrilling summer it was with the Buccos near the top of the standings and even being in first place for a few days. Alas a bad losing streak towards the end of the summer brought the team down in the standings, but a lesson learned, at least they know they can win. A tweek or two here and there, maybe a little money spent on a free agent or two, and find that elusive home run hitter might bring us a title next year.

The early spring and late summer when I'm using allergy medication like a fish uses water, I thought a little natural relief while I sleep would help alleviate the morning sneezing fits. I got one here for an Amazon price of relatively cheap. I also bought some healing stones and crystals. She also carries some impressive jewelry and stones that can be set in necklaces and brackets. The place is huge, and just when you think you've seen everything, you can walk down a hew hallway and find more things. 

Great little shop that reminds me of a shop in a Stephen King novel called Needful Things. Although that shop was owned by Satan and made his customers do unspeakable things to each other, this is far from that. But you do get the feeling here that we are not alone and there are other realms to our world. Books galore on the occult, spirit worlds, shadow people, how to rid your home of evil spirits and I just wish she wasn't closing the store when I was walking in. She was nice enough to stay open until I purchased my salt lamp. I'll return and get my fill of this place and look around for four or five hours."	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 4, u'cool': 2}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

I remember dear old dad and me getting in the car, driving to Banksville road and getting a few slices. I remember that crusty bottom crust, the simple sauce of just tomatoes, the cool cheese on the top, and gooey cheese closer to the hot crust. This is a unique pizza. You get crunchy, chewy, warm, and cool in each bite. Now if you take it home the cheese will melt,(by the way this is the best cold breakfast pizza you'll ever have!) but if you do like locals do, you'll eat it there and enjoy it the way it's supposed to be eaten. The bread fresh from the oven, cold, full fat mozzarella spread on top. Then when you order a slice or two, some very nice Beto pizza chef with a heavy hand will put at least a quarter pound of cheese on each slice. I must get to Beto's soon and have a slice or two and think back to childhood memories and dad.	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 1}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

After seeing Harry Potter 7.1 at the theatre we both proclaimed we were hungry for abnormal pizza. Let me explain, we didn't want to order generic, neighborhood delivery pizza. Pretty much I'm tired of tasteless, no crust pies that lack nuance. Since lesbian friend of Joe D lives in Dormont, Beto's was a natural. She's never had the beto's experience. So I told her to follow my lead, I ordered two slices, one with black olives, the other was plain, small drink. She ordered two slices , extra cheese and pepperoni. I forgot to tell her, nay, I purposely didn't tell her about the cheese because I knew she'd turn her nose up at it because the idea of cheese not melted on a pizza would surely upset the planets and cause disruption in the space/time continuem. But it backfired on me and the one thing I didn't expect was her to order extra cheese. 

We sat down and I explained to her the total stupidity of ordering a large drink in a place that offers free refills. Order a small, it's way cheaper and this really sounds like a scene that could have played out on an episode of Seinfeld.

Pizza time! The look on her face was one of shock, like mine when I realized that America was indeed stupid enough to elect George Bust for a second term. The cheese was piled high, and no visible evidence of anything under this massive mass of diary goodness. Like a trooper she picked up a slice and dived in. She liked it!

After we downed our slices I told her how sitting here has brought me back to my high school years. The pizza still has that same texture, creamy cool cheese, warm crunchy crust, and wonderful smell. Beto's is still my choice for best pie in the Burgh"	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 4, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 2}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

Banksville Beer has a great business, and awesome location. They carry a good selection of all types of beer. Pittsburgh is suddenly having a love affair with IPA's, something I've been in love with for about 9 years now. Great selection here, including 60 and 90 minute, Victory, Ithaca Flower Power, etc.

663	2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw	2011-03-05	xb0JF890hrWqowE360HPDA	4	"This is the second review of The Dor- Stop, I gave it another star this time.

Canadian Friend of Joe (CFoJ) was getting ready to catch the 4:45 flight to Philly, and wanted to share one more meal before leaving the Burgh. He was hungry for breakfast, after all it was only noon and he was still in bed. So he calls me and says meet in Dormont for some serious diner food.

He's already at a table when I walk in, sitting there eating a huge cinnamon roll, split in half, grilled and looking soooo delicious. So he points to the wall and says ""Guy from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives was here"". Spitting pieces of Cinnamon roll at me in his excitement, who knew Canada got the food network?

I ordered the oatmeal pancakes, knowing full well there are eggs in the batter (somethings are just worth having as a vegan) but at least I was smart enough to have the butter on the side so I could discard it later.

He ordered the raspberry french toast, over hard eggs (Canadian for broken yokes) and bacon, a large OJ, coffee, and the cinnamon bun he was noshing when i entered. The man can eat, and he's so thin, I really hate him and his metabolism.

My oatmeal cakes were HUGE, and three to an order, I got the first one down without any problem, they were moist, chewy, flavorful with real oatmeal and cinnamon, and the syrup was almost not needed as they have a natural sweetness to them.

He devoured his french toast, eggs, bacon, saying it was one of the best breakfasts places he's ever been to.

My first expierence with this place was two years ago, I had spent the entire day in the waiting room of St. Clair Hospital with my mother who was admitted finally at 8pm, she was fine and released a few days later. But at 8pm I was ready to eat anything and Bado's was on the way home. So I parked and walked I'm and the place was packed. Good sign. So a seat at the bar opened and the Pens were playing. So I ordered a bottled IPA and read over the menu. I needed to power carb after a long day of sitting in a hospital waiting room. The bartender who doubled as a pizza chef told me the white pizza was exceptional, so I took his advice and ordered a medium, figuring I could have it for lunch the next day. What arrived was this wonderfully thick, cheesy, reeking of garlic in a good way, just what I needed, comfort food that instantly made the days worries seem distant. The first bite was heaven, chewy center, crisp bottom, olive oil coating my mouth, ooey, gooey italian cheeses, saltiness from the black olives I ordered as a topping. This was pizza! Two slices and I was full, I drank my beer and paid the bill, and walked out with lunch and dinner for the next day. I must return here someday and have the same pie.	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 1}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

I met my friend Jean here, she is a once a week customer. Lucky her living on Biddle Street, she lunches daily at different eateries on Braddock ave. One day the Square Cafe (read my review), one day the Map Room, another day D's Packs n Dogs. 

Looking over the menu, my choices were limited to a veggie wrap or salads. I chose a veggie wrap, sans cheese with a side of apple sauce. The wrap was nothing special, mushrooms, spinach, lettuce, tomato, and a side of canned applesauce.

Jean had a buffalo chicken wrap and iced tea. She complained the tea was weak, I never noticed. She said he wrap was good, a chicken breast fried, then drenched in buffalo chicken sauce, then drenched in blue cheese dressing and wrapped in a flour tortilla. 

Dunnings is nothing special, it's a long time establishment that gets by on regulars. This day, the most I saw in the place was 9 people in the bar and dinning room. 

Service was ok, out waitress seemed to be preoccupied with something or someone in the kitchen and it took forever for her to bring the bill to the table."	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 4, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

I see Mad Mex as more Cali Mex with the accent being on fresh ingredients, healthy cooking, and excellent service. The black bean soup is almost fat free and the best I've ever had. (try it Joe D style with a dollop of guac on it instead of sour cream) The lime cilantro salad dressing Is amazing, I've had it on the grilled portobello mushroom salad for a meat free meal. The grilled fish tacos are every bit as good as the famous fish tacos in San Diego. The fish is grilled perfectly, plenty of home made guac, pico, and sour cream accompany this dish. The beer list is a who's who of some of the finest micro brews across the states, including many IPAs which are rotated monthly. You can watch the bartenders squeezing fresh fruits and melons for their huge line ups of margaritas flavors. This little Pittsburgh gem of a restaurant is now opening locations in other cities like Columbus and Philly. There are many locations in the Burgh.	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

Recently I read a few articles about the dangers of non stick cookware. None of them are really any good for any of us. I won't get into what the dangers of them are, but they are real and most non stick cookware will be off the market by 2015.

I started looking into enamel coated cookware, Crate has a number of different varieties and bought myself a 3 piece starter set with an 8, 10, and 12 inch pans. Like non stick, no oils are needed and clean up is pretty quick.

Crate in itself is a cooking gadget Mecca. If you love stainless steel cookware, they have anything you want from All Clad, made right in Canonsburg Pa. There's Fiesta ware from Wheeling, and If you want Emeral's professional cookware , Crate has it.

You can take cooking classes here as well, they have a full service kitchen in back. Classes are limited to certain amounts due to space, but everyone sits after and enjoys the food they've prepped. 

It's top of the line cookware so it has top of the line prices.

A few years ago I undertook a pretty good size project that I had no business even undertaking. I had more questions than a priest in a confessional and the great associates here at Greentree hardware answered each one of them for me, even drawing me a diagram for one tricky part of this project. When I went to purchase some things I thought I might need, the associate told me not to waste money buying a certain brand and the cheaper part would be just fine. Now that's service! Now, I'll go out of my way to give this place my business and keep them a float.	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 2}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

677	zpNGtjBlIkDq_PLGSCPlAg	2014-01-27	GRjn7bvtUCVnmeTPZXm72g	2	"Being born and raised into an all Italian family, I'm pretty darn picky about my pastas and gravy (tomato sauce for the unknowing). My great grandmother's sauce was the first I remember, she never opened a can to make her sauces, always using tomatoes she canned herself in mason jars. She simmered her sauces until every seed melted away. My mother's sauce was a bit more thicker, using puree and paste as a base, later adding whole peeled tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil. Her sauce cooks down to a velvety pasta sauce that should be jarred and sold on super market shelves.

Sorry on to my review of Olive Garden. seriously? Really? No! I will admit it's good in a fit of really, REALLY needing a pasta fix, or if you want to eat breadstick and salad. But the sauces are overly rich, and I don't mean the tomato sauces. I mean the sauces they put over the pasta with chicken, beef or fish. And, let me be real Italian here, pasta is NEVER the main meal in an Italian supper, Pasta is normally the first course and NEVER served with meat, including MEATBALLS. Thats as American as fortune cookies. after pasta, comes the protein, that includes meatballs, then finally salad.

Okay, I'm done being a snooty Italian who looks down upon Olive Garden, I got out all my frustrations on you, my readers. But seriously, if you want good Italian food, hit up a REALLY good neighborhood, family owned Italian restaurant. The service is better, it will be cheaper and it won't go to a big conglomerate who over charges on a plate of pasta, which is one of the cheapest food you can serve. Oh, two stars for a pretty good bowl of Pasta Fazoo (pasta and beans)."	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 2}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

Listen when I tell you, go to their website and request, demand, beg, do anything you can to get them to open one here in Pittsburgh! Seriously, the whole wheat Long Island bagels are pretty damn fine. Boiled, then baked a little darker than most bagels, then doused with garlic and onion, poppy and sesame seeds. Incredibly delicious! They're California Granola bagels are whole grain and hearty. The Italian bagels are like a mini loaf of Italian bread, covered in oregano, basil, rosemary, and garlic, they put olive oil in the raw dough, bellisimo! 

Okay, 359 miles southwest we have Pittsburgh with no visible sign of a decent bagel place, well that's not entirely true, Einstein Brothers has a good bagel, not a great bagel. Where Ithaca Bakery has 9 different vegetarian sandwiches, good luck trying to find anything like that here. 

When I did enjoy meats, my choice here was the Nova Lox with a shmear, tomato, onion on a whole wheat bagel. Not exactly a low cal meal, later I found out it had a whopping 700 calories and over 20 grams of fat. Even with the lite cream cheese this had 600 calories and 12 grams of fat. Now I have a whole grain bagel with hummus. 

I will say their pretzel bagels are rather good, nice crust and crunch from salt, a chewy center and makes an awesome pizza bagel.

Their bagels are pretty expensive, a baker's dozen and a container of cream cheese is over 14 bucks. In a town with a pizza joint on every corner, and an Italian restaurant in every community, you'd think someone would open an authentic bagel place with unique flavors and varieties."	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 2}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

My first visit here was before Yelp was just a glint in it's founder's father's eye. And i listened as an old man (The founder?) was telling me about the old days, and how many men died when coffee roasters would catch fire and explode. Not sure how true those stories were, but hey, he was an old man, and I was fresh out of college. Like most college students my common sense eventually came back, but that's another story.

Well he took me back and showed me the raw beans, and how they roasted them. It was very interesting. Then he made me a cup of coffee with bean just out of the roaster, slightly cooled, he ground them in front of me, then put them in a french press and let it steep for 4 minutes. Damn, that was the best cup of Joe I ever had. So the very next day I bought a french press, went back to Nicholas Coffee, and bought a pound of espresso roast and I've been hooked every since.

Unfortunately the City Paper has all but vanished from the scene, in it's place a weekly paper hits the stands with nothing but ads, a few music reviews and a restaurant review. Oh, how I miss the days when In Pittsburgh and The City Paper were vying for readership.

What happened to that edgy, ruffling of the feathers wit we used to get in stories that meant something? Did the editor lose touch? Did he grow old and lose that liberal ferocity? Or, did every hungry reporter leave town and head to NYC to work at The Village Voice, a REAL alternative newspaper that has more readers than the Times.

In a large college town like Pittsburgh, a real alternative weekly should be covering college sports, national and local politics, pop culture, the local music scene, computer news, finances...etc.

Instead we get a weekly story, nothing that needs much undercover work, nothing that would cause local politicians to shake in their boots. Nothing that would cause the Post Gazette to stand up and take notice. Basically running feel good stories that will keep the City Paper out of the courts.

As much as I hate Mark Madden, at least when he wrote a story in the City Paper it was edgy, eye opening, and he was usually correct.

The City Paper is in need of new blood, after all it's 2010 and the editor needs replaced in favor of hungrier reporters who have a story worth telling."	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 1}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

I orders the bacon cheese burger with grilled onions and potato salad (no fryer, hence, no fries) LFOJ orders the same, exceptin' she gets the home fries.

I orders an iPA since I find that's the best tasting beer for wood fired grilled meat. LFOJ orders a bottle of Coors light

Our burgers are brought out and when it was put in front of me, the smell was truly a religious experience. Like a hundred and forty three angels were singing the Ava Maria.

My burger was grilled a perfect medium rare, LFOJ ordered her burger medium, the first bite was an incredible burst of grilled beef flavor, so much so, the bacon was completely overpowered.

The sauce was normal, kinda sweet, garlicky, nothing special. Loaded with cheese that had pools of grease swimming on it. Knowing I don't eat meat my friends ordered me a half pizza with peppers and onions. It was still dripping with grease. I removed the cheese and just ate the crust with the vegetables. I was still kind of dumbfounded as to why this place gets raves. The crust was nothing to write home about, it was just kind of yeasty and chewy. I definitely don't see what all the fuss is. When I'm going to have a cheat day with pizza it's Beto's for me.	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

I checked and saw that indeed, I had not. It's been a good six months since my last visit, I remember what I ordered and how good the entire experience was.

I ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce and an order of bok choy which was steamed first, then quickly stir fried, delicious. The eggplant was tender, a touch of heat from chilis, garlicky, meaty and filling, served with brown rice, very nutritious. My family all ordered something different, Judy, my cousin who thinks China Gate is the finest Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh, and would come here at the drop of a hat, ordered her Chicken and Green Beans. I must admit, when I did eat meat, I've had this on many occasions and it's really very good. The green beans are crisp tender, the chicken is finely ground,  moist, and tender.

Over all Mark Pi's China Gate is good Chinese food, served in a nice atmosphere, and a great value for your hard earned buck."	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 2}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

Also on the menu is a greens free salad called Alexander The Great. It's Quinoa, chopped red peppers, Feta cheese, cucumbers, cured olives and a lemon vinaigrette. Light, yet filling from the protein packed Quinoa, it's a great dish for those HOT summer nights and sitting on the deck, great with a cold IPA or a Malbec. 

Both restaurants offer great servers, bartenders and friendly hosts. If you're a snooty Yelper and expect white collar waitstaff, these bars aren't going to be for you. If you are looking for a fun place to eat and imbibe, meet honest to goodness down to earth people, then the Harris and Shiloh grills are for you. Open for lunch now at 11:31 am. I removed a star because I had to circle the bar three times before I could park my car."	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08
688	bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A	2010-08-16	IkNcxgQI9R1hfjZdl3IqvA	4	Voted Pittsburgh's best eatery many years in a row. This old Roman Catholic church turned brewery/restaurant had great ales and specialty brews, an extensive wine list, a huge vodka selection and the best menu in western Pennsylvania. The brick oven pizzas are incredible with imaginative toppings.  Try a sampling of all the beers including the bottled fresh Thundergod IPA, and the Pius monk dunkle. All of the stained glass windows are intact and all of the tables and bar stools were fabricated from the church pews. The outdoor patio area reminds me of eating outdoors in Germany. One is completely surrounded by red brick ivy covered walls. I've had friends from New York, Vancouver, and Toronto visit Pittsburgh and I've taken them here for dinner and they all had a great time. They also have said that the Church Brew Works is a one of a kind place and only Pittsburgh could pull it off.	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

Is it Italian? Even New York Pizza isn't considered true Italian. Thin dough, olive oil, fresh tomato, whole milk or buffalo mozzarella, and fresh basil. That's a true Italian gem.

Let's dissect a Chicago pizza, why does the crust taste like biscuit dough? 'Nuff said. Sausage between the layers of dough? So you steam the sausage? Sounds disgusting when you think about it.

A wonderfully extra thick pretzel cut in half, slathered with sauce, and topped with your favorite pizza toppings, a pretzel pizza, screw the low carb diet!  Or, take the same pretzel, cut it in half and pile on turkey and cheddar, or ham and swiss, and you have a great sandwich with the extra crunch of salt from the pretzel top. What else do you need? Grab a sack full or a dozen or so pizza pretzels take them home, pop them in the oven and you have a great meal for the big game.

I ordered a half veggie hoagy and a bowl of vegetable soup. My friend Ross ordered a small pizza and a bowl of wedding soup. I was sipping on a pretty good Rooney pale ale which was the best part of the meal. A little while later our soup came in cups. We told the bartender we ordered bowls. Oops. I was fighting a cold and a nice hot bowl of vegetable soup would hit the spot. Still waiting for the soup, out came the pizza, looked good, tons of cheese and pepperoni, and my veggie hoagy.  My order was wrong again, I ordered a half and they gave me a whole Hoagy. No biggie, I'll take the other half home for a midnight snack. Still no sign of the soup! It was a pretty unremarkable hoagy. Lots of flavorless lettuce, green peppers, onion, and huge unchewable chunks of carrots, and worse, it was cold. I Was kind of hoping for some eggplant, roasted red peppers, grilled zucchini, you know a real veggie hoagy with some flavor and texture. Oh we'll, live and learn. Still no soup! Finally the bartender was finished watching TV and saw we were both out of beer, and I asked about the soup, he apologized and said he forgot. I said to Ross, I guess he must make a good hourly wage because he's not working for a good tip. Finally our soup was delivered and I pushed away that lousy hoagy and dived into soup. I blew on the spoonful of soup and Ross said ""you don't have to do that, it's cold."" Damn! With a half eaten hoagy and a full bowl of soup sitting there, I asked for the check and paid and left. Never again Big Jim, never again! Guy, you lost points on this call."	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 4, u'useful': 5, u'cool': 2}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

Much like the NY handsome cabs or trolley cars of San Fransisco, the Duquesne and Monongahela Inclines are identifiable with Pittsburgh. 

More than just an incline ride, there is also a small, but informative incline museum, gift shop and a self guided tour of the incline's underbelly. This is also a Pittsburgh tourist stop, complete with information center. 

There is a parking lot at the station house below at Station Square and street parking at the station house up top in Duquesne Heights. There's also an observation deck next to the station house on Grandview Avenue, with that iconic view of downtown. 

The ride is less than two minutes but well worth the small amount they charge, 5 dollars round trip for adults, 2.50 for kids and children under 5 are free."	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 7, u'cool': 10}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

Cheers was 90's TV show about a bar where everybody knew your name. The Shiloh grill is that bar on Mount Washington. Walk in the greeter knows you, the bartender knows you and so does the kitchen staff, bar back and waiter or waitress. The bar is small (half point deduction) and if you can find a seat you'll get meet some nice bartenders and barbacks who seem to not be able to do enough to make your visit perfect. The seemingly endless drink menu is loaded with unique drinks. I love the blueberry basil lemonade, lemon vodka, home made sours mix, then the bartender crushes fresh basil and blueberries into the glass and pours the vodka and sours over that. Great drink to enjoy on the patio which overlooks Shiloh Street. Great wine selection (Wednesday is Wine Wednesday, glasses of wine 6 Bucks all day) and a rather impressive selection of bottled and tapped micro brews. Being an IPA fan, I'm giddy with excitement when I walk in to see what new IPAs I can enjoy with their great food! 

Which brings me to the menu! This is one entertaining menu, seriously you'll giggle at the way each menu item is described. The hummus is off the charts delicious. Creamy and chunky at the same time. Flavored perfectly and served with fresh veggies and warm pita. The Alexander the Greek salad is a lettuce free salad of quinoa, tomato, onion, cucumber, olives and feta cheese, it's a refreshing, light meal, also served with warm pita. The menu is loaded with pub and comfort foods like Mac and Cheese, burgers, steaks , sandwiches and pastas. For dessert you gotta try the homemade chocolate chip cookie baked and served in a cast iron skillet, served with vanilla bean ice cream! Yeah, I know, your mouth is watering. 

I love this place if you can find a parking spot (this is where they lose another half star) because their lot is small. If you live on the Mount, walking to the Shiloh might be your best bet."	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 1}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

703	63M2e_wSmQ8GbLDUau5K6Q	2010-08-24	7NqZlKOC1Y9DWJhCu1hf_g	4	This place is off the beaten path of Mt Washington restaurants, located in a neighborhood that could use sprucing up. There is a small parking lot on the side of the building. It's a spacious restaurant with two tops and four tops and even a few tables set up for larger parties and family style seating. Standard Italian flare starts things off, a waiter comes to the table and announced all the specials, which on this night they featured a pork loin and a shrimp dish. Neither sounded appealing since I had my heart set on one of their standard dishes, chicken Jolene, this is a huge chicken breast wrapped with eggplant lightly sauteed then finished in the oven. A butter/lemon/garlic sauce finishes this excellent dish. For my pasta course I had vodka sauce over imported penne, which was excellent. My appetizer was a peasant dish called greens and beans. You can't get more Italian than this dish, collards and white beans sauteed in extra virgin olive oil with sausage and garlic and lots of fresh bread to soak up the juices. It's BYOB for wine, bring a good red wine with you. Next time I come I want to try the pasta with bacon and peas, that sounds great.	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 1}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

To be totally serious, I've had the food twice, once in house, the previous time it was take out. I ordered the vegetable fried rice for the take out meal. Seemed overly salty and lacked the umami essence. Which leads to the time I ate in...

Lord, my chicken tasted like ammonia, I ordered the lemon chicken with brown rice. Seriously my diced chicken not only had the flavor of ammonia but smelled like a bottle of Windex. The waiter (owner,chef?) came over to see if me and my date were okay, I told him the chicken tasted funny. My date said the sweet and sour pork tasted fine. He took my chicken away. Then came back and asked me if I wanted something else from the beef or pork section of the menu. Whoop Whoop Whoop!!! Danger! Danger Will Robinson!!

Also found some wonderful imported olive oils, pastas, canned tomatoes and what is that wonderful smell coming from behind the counter? The deli girl was frying hot peppers in olive oil. I'll take that entire pan of peppers and a loaf of bread and make a meal of that! Unfortunately she was just making lunch for the staff, after the peppers were cooked she added crumbled hot sausage and about a dozen eggs and made a huge frittata. I wonder how she got my father's recipe? Oh, wait, all Italians make this. 

Sorry, let me get back to the review, It's so tiny here that i and two other customers were a crowd, but Groceria Merante has the authentic flavors of Italy.

But believe me it's there right next to Starbucks and the Olive Garden. 
   
The menu is extensive with breakfast served anytime up until closing at four. I've had many different items on the menu including the eggwhite and turkey sausage breakfast bagel. It's wonderful on the asiago cheese bagel, whole wheat, and the good grains bagel. The turkey rueben excels on pumpernickel bagel and the rye bagel, and is easily the heartiest of the sandwiches. 

     I have a deep seated love of nova lox with all the fixings. Einstein Bros  does it right with a nice schmear of cream cheese, a thin slice of lox, sliced purple onion, tomato, and capers. This is how to enjoy breakfast, and with a cup of their French roast coffee, it's a great way to start the day. Beware, the lox and bagel breakfast can have a whopping 600 calories, I lighten it up by putting it on a bagel thin, and having them use the light cream cheese. Have the bagel toasted.  

After all the tastings I've come to the conclusions that I really like Einstein Bros bagels, especially the good grains bagel. They have great sandwiches, soups, sides and coffee.

I was at a red light when I noticed a parking spot near this bakery. Not too often you can get a spot on Murray right near the place you're going to, so I took it as a sign.

I'd been here before, the first time was late on a Sunday afternoon, when I walked in just about everything was sold out, I had my mouth watering for texas toast made with  Allegro's 12 grain whole wheat bread. Damn Like Seinfeld, someone ahead of me got the last loaf. I settled for a regular whole wheat. I really enjoyed it. 

This time I was lucky and got the 12 grain I wanted. This bread is pretty amazing with lightly browned smoked tofu, charred arugula, peppered greek olives, and veganaise. No vegan restaurant makes a sandwich like that.(Thanks Deb! She's my dietician)

If it is black and gold and you can wear it on your person you'll find it here.	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 4}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

They have all the knick-knacks that every Italian household had. I still remember every room had a picture of Jesus, one whole wall of my Gramma's kitchen was decorated with calenders, why you ask? They were colorful, and everyone from banks, to churches to the local funeral parlor gave them out at Christmas time, they were a cheap way to decorate, no lie! Italians loved colorful little things that they could put everywhere, and this is what you get at Buca di Beppo.

The food's not bad either, I had a dish that was pasta with a delicious plumb tomato and fresh herb sauce. I swear the ""single"" serve lunch special was a pound and a half of pasta and easily twelve ounces of sauce. Was it authentic? Nah, not in the least. Was it good? Damn right it was, fresh herbs kick the flavors of everything up. The waiter started off the lunch by bringing over a few baskets of warm bread, and ""making"" a dipping ""sauce"" as we called it back in the day. he mixed some olive oil, dried herbs and balsamic vinegar on a plate, we all dug in!  Gramma would cut her home made bread and heat up a little olive oil with smashed garlic, add salt and pepper and we'd dip our bread into it for an authentic Italian lunch. We'd also have dried salami, chunks of Romano cheeses and fresh fruit with wine. That's the way we used to eat back when I was growing up with my ""Little Gramma"". 

Buca also has giant meatballs, lasagna, ravioli, and a pretty darn good looking sicilian style pizza done only with flesh mozzerella, and fresh basil on a bed of simple sauce. Come hungry and be prepared to take home lots of doggie bags."	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 1}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

Yes, I know most of the shrimp is frozen and prepared elsewhere and shipped to the 200 or so Joe's all over the country. Maybe it's the atmosphere, location, I think it's all of those reasons, and the food. I did a quick tip and proclaimed the burger with the fried shrimp and Cajun mayo one of the finest burgers I've ever had. Think about it, a juicy quarter pound burger still pink on the inside, a handful of tender fried shrimp on top of that. Purple onion, tomato, shredded lettuce and a huge dollop of spicy Cajun mayo that tastes so good it makes you want to swear. That's not all, the salads are amazing, the crab pots are good but not my thing. Onion rings are a Joe's specialty, I'd walk across broken glass and hot coals in a two dollar pair of Old Navy flip flops for those onion rings. Leave it to me though to go to a seafood place for a burger, but i say build a better burger and they will come. For an appetizer I love the spicy stuffed mushrooms or the crab cake. Not the best crab cake mind you, but it will do to take away the craving. I wash it all down with a super sweet and salt around the rim ""Shake a Rita"". It's not a meal I'd eat weekly or even monthly, but when the gang says let's go to Joe's I'm the first in the car with mouth watering!"	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

This place has all the charm of a country store, lots of baked goods, great fresh and aged meats, seafood, charcuterie, deli, cheeses, coffees, and fresh produce, jams and jellies, spices, condiments and so much more. 

Before my vegan days I would spend time at the meat counter buying brisket, chops, veal, and their wonderful fishcakes. The fishcakes are a great mixture of whitefish, crab, lobster, and shrimp. The McGinnis sister associates would then add secret ingredients, and all you need to do is take them home and pop them in the oven, they make great sandwiches!

Great breads like cracked wheat, whole grain, bagels, Italian, and sour dough. They also have cookies and pies.

The produce is really where McGinnis sister's shine. Possibly the freshest produce in town, except for the strip district.

Great deli, lots of boar's head meats and cheeses, pickled eggs, salads, pickles, olives, charcuterie, and lots more.

Like any good market you're paying more for premium products so you won't shop here on a regular basis. It's not hard to drop two c notes here on one visit.

716	mKEUpLDkL_SZvjI5Hc9gpw	2013-02-23	T1f7N_ahr4u0ANpqP5yHwQ	3	"I'm very surprised that This review is only the 24th of this established Pittsburgh landmark restaurant. After all, this is their third location, having established themselves on Mt Washington right on Grandview Ave. this is where I fell in love with their food. I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review. 

My last visit here was in October of 2012, I had a cousin visiting from San Diego and on her last night she wanted Armstrongs. They were able to seat the twelve of us without any issues. The place was empty, odd for Armstrongs, but it was a weeknight and only about 5:30. The menu is long and extensive, as any well established Italian restaurant would be. I narrowed my choices to the Fusilli with marinara or eggplant parm. I chose the pasta fearing the eggplant would be deep fried, loaded with fatty cheese. It was, one of our party ordered it and it was saturated with grease.

Four waiters brought out food to the table and honestly when the food was sitting on the table I said it reminded me of when my great grandmother would cook Sunday Supper after 11am mass. The portions here are huge and just good old fashioned home style cooking.  My fusilli was perfectly al dente, the marinara was a tad watery, but flavorful, even without the addition of parm cheese. A little red pepper gave it some zing and excitement. My mother had the fish sandwich with fries and slaw and said it was as good as she remembered. Two huge fillets of cod, batter dipped with tarter sauce.  Most of the table had lasagna, which is a huge portion. 

Armstrongs will never be fashionable in the foodies circle, it is what it is, home style cooking with huge portions and a place that brings back lots of good memories, and fills the belly."	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 5, u'cool': 5}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

718	2Yv6Tgb5mpoEo3_EIpKs3g	2014-02-23	x5c5vXq7320LuYPpGI8XmA	2	"Many years ago I was in love with the idea of restaurants like Fridays, Chili's, Applebee's and the like. Not so much today as my tastes in food matures. Besides cooking at home, I'd much rather spend my disposable income on family owned businesses, people who put their heart and souls into their business. 

Houlihan's was never my to go to place, even when I was frequenting these so called casual dining spots. The food was never well done in my opinion. But then again, these restaurants always seemed to copy each other's menus. Houlihan's just never caught their niche. They basically just serve dishes that are nothing special.

As a kid, we'd all get in my cousin's car on a friday night during Lent and go to Benkovits and order fish sandwiches and bring them back home to our waiting family. Sometimes we'd order as many as 17 sandwiches with fries and onion rings and walk back into the house with 7 bags of food. Of course the kids would sit on the living room floor and the adults would eat at the table. Oh those memories! 

Those fish sandwiches were huge, each sandwich housing two huge pieces of battered cod and those hand cut fries. Made Lent worth giving up meat.

Benkovitz was a Strip icon since the sixties, but in business for over 100 years. When PNC Park opened in 2001 a Benkovits was there, selling those fish sandwiches in their own little corner of the stadium.

I'll miss them, they were a part of Pittsburgh and I and the rest of Pittsburgh will miss them!

The basics, the specials, the chef's specials etc. it's good food, it's just not anything special. 

On a recent night I had the vegetable  fried rice and stir fried string beans. The rice had that smokey umami flavors we all love, nice chunks of broccoli, carrots, and straw mushrooms. The beans were crisp tender, again, the umami flavors we are accustom to from Chinese food shined through. But, again it's just not special.

Bad owners, bad management, a record of terrible draft picks, even the mascot died! True story, in the early days, when the Penguins wore blue everyday, they had a live penguin who would walk on the ice between periods. Well, it died. A promising rookie also died the same year in a car accident. The Penguins seemed like a team with a curse attached to it. Until...

In 1984 the Penguins were the worst team in the league, finishing dead last. But what a year to finish last. We earned the first pick in the entry draft which brought current co-owner and the greatest player to ever lace up skates, Mario Lemieux. Finally, our luck was changing, and Mario brought two Stanley Cups to the City of Champions. But, again, the curse was back, more bad management, bad draft picks, and chapter eleven gave Mario the chance to co-own the team. Could history repeat itself? Again, the Penguins were one of the worst teams in the league, and winning the draft lottery, earned the right to draft Sydney Crosby. A year earlier they drafted Geeno Malkin. Giving them the two best players in hockey. A few years later, Sid the Kid hoisted the Stanley Cup and brought Pittsburgh It's third cup. 

Then, the Penguin's home began to crumble and needed a new place to play. Kansas City lured the Pens with a new hockey rink, Las Vegas also wanted them. Could we lose our Pens? Finally the city and state came up with the cash to build the Penguins their new home! Now, lets bring the Cup back to Pittsburgh and party all summer long!"	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 4}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

We arrived, and if I hadn't been shown how to find this place I would have never found it, It literally is a hole in the wall. But when you enter the place is a full sized eatery. It's like Bucca De Beppo without the clutter. 

Our waiter arrived just seconds after being seated, dressed in black pants and a white shirt, slicked back hair, looking around, all the waiters looked like clones of each other. With him were two carafes of wine, red and white. Then he expertly explained the daily specials, including an eggplant lasagna that sounded amazing. But I had my heart set on this amazing linguini with white clam sauce. John ordered the eggplant lasagna, and I ordered the Linguini, and we said we'd share since the portions were so huge. John also got a meatball.

We sat a bit talking about our success at the blackjack table and how we were always so close on the Roulette table. I had a good day at the sports book, picking the Steelers over the Browns (duh) and picking the rams and teasing them with Buffalo. So yeah, I was picking up the tab. Not bad wine for being free. Garlic bread was delivered, nice and cheesy, garlic out the wahzoo! Very good indeed.

Our waiter arrived with two HUGE, oversized bowls, one containing my linguini, the other the eggplant lasagna. and two smaller plates for us to share. (no extra charge for sharing!) Can I say I come from a big Italian family, I saw my father eat healthy amounts of pasta at one setting, but I had never seen a bowl of linguini with clams as big as this for one person. I even said to the waiter ""are you sure this is mine and not for a table of four?"" He assured me this was a single serving. I swear it was over a pound of pasta and a pound of clams. Fresh grated Ramono cheese was dusted over the top, and plenty of cracked pepper. He even left the cheese grater and a healthy block of cheese at the table for us to help ourselves.

The pasta was perfectly al dente, a bit of bite and wonderful flavor from the clams. The clams were very tender, meaty and succulent. John's Eggplant Lasagna was very dense, flavorful, but a bit greasy from frying the eggplant. There was a lot of different cheeses used, I could taste ricotta, Parm, Romano, and a smokey cheese, maybe Provolone? Aside from the grease, it was delicious, rich and tasty. The meatball was very dense, stuffed with all kinds of fresh herbs and garlic. It was easily six ounces.

Battista's is a great place in a great city, after you've had your fill of buffets and quick bites, go have a wonderful sit down meal at an Italian restaurant that does it right."	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 6, u'cool': 3}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

This is one museum I hate and love at the same time. The first time I visited I was invited by some college students at Point Park U. I work with. They were putting on a play and gave me a pass for free admission. I hadn't planned on going but things fell through with previous plans and I found myself at the museum. I was guided to the theatre and found I had front row seating. The lights went out and the curtain pulled back and for the next 45 minutes I was watching naked college students in a huge shower screaming at the top of their lungs while red and black water sprayed on them. Um.....

The next time I went, it was for Andy Warhol's 85th birthday celebration and admission was 85 cents, not a bad savings of $14.15, I'm not cheap but a good deal is a good deal! I loved seeing all the familiar pieces, the Marilyn Monroes, the Jackie Kennedy Onassiss' the Brillobox and of course all his self portraits. The silver cloud room is an amazing piece of installation artwork, you have to see it for the full experience. I was also treated to silk screening my very own Andy Warhol portrait in the basement, which I framed and have hanging in my bathroom. Whenever I have friends visiting I make sure we always visit Andy, even though he's turning over in his grave because his remains and museum are both in his much hated hometown. If you love Warhol's work or just love 60's, 70's and early 80's pop art or are just a pop culture nut like me, you'll love the Warhol."	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08
727	vvPzcOhbQn5fLQUAIxcP6A	2014-01-16	eGPHp9U2LUxTxgp28zPCTQ	3	Long on my list of places to try, I finally got to this long time Pittsburgh breakfast spot. Friend of Joe's, Kevin was in town for some R&R and called me on a cold Thursday morning for breakfast, I offered Deluca's as a choice since I've never been there and neither has he. After he accepted, I got to thinking how bad parking was in the strip. Low and behold a spot opened about a half block away. We walked in and immediately were seated in the same booth Adam Richman sat in filming a spot for Man Vs Food some years back. Once seated, a waitress zoomed in with menus, coffee cups and a hot pot of coffee, almost reading my mind. The coffee was okay, nothing special, think the same coffee at Eat N Park or Kings, a little disappointing. Looking over the menu it was loaded with Pittsburgh favorites and gluttonous offerings. I choose the thin, crepe like pancakes served with loganberry preserves. Kevin on the other hand chose the Steel City breakfast, 2 hot cakes, sausage, bacon, eggs, and toast made from Macinie's bread. It was huge amount of food. My crepe like pancakes were lite, airy and delicious. The loganberry preserves with the perfect compliment for them, adding a touch of sweetness, a perfect foil for the savory crepes. The bill came to under 16 bucks which isn't too bad, about the same as Eat N Park or King's. the only trouble is parking, and would derail me from making this one of my go to places.	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08

Anyway, he had found a deal at his travel agent, he booked us two different deals, one was at Treasure Island, that deal included airfare. The other deal was two days and three nights at the Stratosphere, free. When you checked in they gave you 100 dollars in free slot play, 50 bucks cash, and free buffet. All we had to do was check in, go to the room, mess up the beds and go stay in comfort at  Treasure Island. One catch, we had to participate in a slot tourniment one of the days we were there. You had to sign up at the front desk. The tourny was every hour on the hour from 8 am to 8pm. So we signed up for 2 pm the next day to fullfill our requirements to recieve the free room.

The Stratosphere was in some sort of finacial trouble it seems and were giving rooms away to get people to gamble in their hotel. So we got our room keys (NO BELLHOPS?) we took a very old, creeky elevator to our floor and when John opened up his door he noticed people in bed watching TV, it was pretty funny, not to the people in bed though, but I still chuckle about it when he brings it up. They got it straighten out and apologized.

The place was a hole, I mean a real dump. We couldn't wait to get out of there and check in at Treasure Island. We each had fifty bucks cash from the Stratosphere and returned the next day to play in the tourny, I did'nt do very well, there but i did dump the hundred dollers in free slot play in a 5 dollare machine and walked out well ahead.

But seriously, there are so many nice places to stay in Vegas.

Mad Mex is one of the few restaurants in the city that can make about 90% of whatever's on the menu and make it vegan or veg. And, if you have other dietary needs like lower fat options, they'll accommodate your needs. That's how we'll they take care of their guests. I love the angry hippy quesadilla, sautéed spicy spinach, mushrooms and vegan cheese stuffed in a whole wheat tortilla, grilled nice and crispy, served with the best guacamole in the city and a tasty vegan sour cream. Wash that down with one of many micro brews on tap and you'll be a happy mad mex fan.

730	Q4ULAiIE2qCA4RYplCTrUQ	2010-10-11	v2CsD_YBLp1B2c_grrr79Q	1	Okay, a friend came back to the burgh for a long weekend and after much pleading, begging, and finally, paying me off to take her to this popular Pittsburgh heart clogging, frat boy hangout. If you've had one, you've had every sandwich they sell. They all taste the same, maybe if they salted the fries? Anyway I guess I outgrew the taste of these grease balls. A cold Sam Adams was sitting in front of me and suddenly I thought of it, I can eat healthy by getting turkey, no cheese, fries, or mayo. The waiter looked perplexed after asking him if I could just have turkey with onion, slaw, and tomato. Didn't matter, my sandwich came with fries anyway, guess you can't teach an old dog new tricks. I picked the fries off and gave them to my friend, who by the way does not take Zocor. As I stated before in a quick note, this original Primanti's is basically a tourist trap, Oakland college getaway, and food network geek paradise. I'll go to the primanti full service restaurant on the other side of Crafton where they cook a bit healthier and offer lighter fare.	review	bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 1}	3.52	{u'profile': 4, u'funny': 39, u'cute': 1, u'plain': 165, u'writer': 39, u'list': 2, u'note': 93, u'photos': 13, u'hot': 23, u'more': 13, u'cool': 101}	[2011, 2013, 2014, 2015]	14	[40brdk7YnfRXHr8VuZIjxg, DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, 65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ, KMKgEPsB8j7RrELtv6u-_A, DCgtELzmQnIWrVRUMKyVMw, nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA, TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 5SLDX3bXcRP52QlStIcYLg, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, slVCyH-xCSj4caCW5it3ag, 5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA, HEBlqsa4Ehs_6Vtzde4WVA, D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w, x64wENtrpxU9IZ_-pk4AIA, pzhiDEp8EFltFmdldP9Oow, LlYFud6bzQeBOdS9hYdZpw, oupgo3fb2kl4AbJ35fhk3w, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, olT2J66OB2HFlRymvqkxZA, RnrVGMWolNXYWzgHg1hyVg, 63Pop3d15pTuHZ7qoex46w, q7Zn9s5wXAjhhSJMf7GiVg, UPnvrK4XpHDZsyLisCcLQw, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, gSXgEuv2wf4QBwzu8ySbig, DD3fOuL8bo6jrEsSeQHx9A, hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w, LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg, _ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw, 0xIQG-NrqMx5id6yJpQp8Q, TIFX0jkfFLpsPWvsHqSdng, TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA, dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ, GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA, -Gdjho_gZhgTXkYmSPy0qw, _6kTwDljW2uzfQp5ISvW4w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, hymzD1oSKFNRGbymIC3HXw, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, C3MHaW2n0GBi5l5TcZuZPA, 5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 6-tqgTQcacy0suvBeagbJg, nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA, vgI1tOD4k8qUJs7oIOOwZA, FQ7kbeHMbknV8DnavADPdg, UewXBN0pcopXmhG3PYuhvA, pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ, Cpxzna2rsIAdbFXw4MQaGw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg, -Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg, mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA, sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, C6xo4k-u7Xr1oCNX0RyAAA, cyR-gMXzH6EphQKWj2tz0w, neOOSMNWcVL0o2Xwb0goVg, k_MOe2ZPz8PrAP5EY3vrZQ, t3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, HwqAGCDK9dKZM4lCdrYbvg, 3ppZ7lv-KnUBpO_73pdXTA, QJT5LXiMSjYOHkcayHU7Ew, u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow, 6LKMWe1vdW3-MV6bkbCHhA, Plh8JoySyyyy3U5AtqmCiQ, JTrnfLb7SHBPp23oh0337Q, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, Q3uW1onTdP114NM616XyaA, iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ, KcuAjM26igGLKhslCE1Tig, 6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ, f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw, zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A, vOz8Tgfe9ujzb4Tjw_boZg, QIMAP9HwcvivDokpd16ieQ, MzyUCQD3CtIQ0ifkYKl8iQ, 8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw, ukb04UfxSSQJfE9R7BHD2Q, 2ygX4ki3hNXF2e3kIEQcrA, ArzZ7FDQg32D7z3FrGq6Zw, ugmG1DMOfQgrNE_d2FfN5g, fsjn4lin0ba-gPaHHcSGmA, mUDbZbMo-3Q08ecE9GlIVg, z5RZsHsjvIdSEc9NstcpXA, gVjmqzlBzf7fi7wXA0inww, -nYWT--flsvUsPshFR5uWw, ...]	Joe	504	user	{u'funny': 639, u'useful': 1381, u'cool': 879}	2010-08
731	_v6HIliEOn0l0YaAmBOrxw	2012-01-27	jP-PLUe16R8TliKA0Cs6tQ	4	"This is my favorite hotel in Vegas. I love the atmosphere, the food, the casino, and just about everything else about TI. Last time here my travel agent got me a flight out of Pittsburgh with a brief layover in Cincinnatti (stayed on the plane, a boarded a few passengers) and was in Vegas 5 hours later. We each got a single room with a huge king size bed for 327, including airfare, 5 days and four nights. We could not pass up this deal. It departed the day after thanksgiving and Vegas was pretty barren. 

When we checked it, the front desk clerk gave us a coupon book good for many free items, including some things located right at Treasure Island. One of the items was a coupon good for twenty five dollars in slot play up the street at the Stratosphere. There were also free meals, BOGO buffets, two for one helecoptor tours of Hoover Dam, ETC.

The rooms were huge, nice and clean except for one thing, my toilet didn't flush, I called the front desk and they apologized and sent up a bellhop to get my bags and upgraded me to a suite. What a great suite it was too. Nice living room area, walk in closet, and giant bedroom with a california king sized bed. I could travel like this a lot!

Great casino here at TI, I found the slots to be pretty loose, the blackjack dealers are extremely friendly, and, they have a great sportsbook.

It's not one of the newer hotels, but this place is still my favorite place on the strip to gamble, and stay when I come to Vegas.

Today's visit was to purchase some general car supplies as a holiday gift. They carry basically everything you need for self service. I'm not overly sure on their pricing but since it is convenient for me I visit it.

Normally both of your feet are measured for accuracy.  Most styles come in European sizes so I am familiar with the size I normally wear.

They also sell orthotics which you can put in sneakers or special orthodics for dress shoes. If you have a foot problem they will give give you 10% off your purchase of the orthotic once your mention your doctor's name.

I normally come here for sneakers, sandals and on rare occasion a dress shoe. They offer a reward program for the amount of your purchase once you reach a certain threshhold.

I have never had a problem with any of my orthotics and give them a high recommendation. They do offer trunk shows which was the reason for my recent visit since I needed a pair of summer sandals and a waterproof sneaker for an upcoming trip. Normally they sell New Balance for sneakers and their prices are relatively comparable to that which you would find in other shoe stores.

However, the do carry some better lines so expect to pay a little more if you want the quality of a name brand shoe. You are permitted to purchase the items and try it around the house to see if you are comfortable with it. If unhappy then you have two weeks to return it at which point it becomes a final sale.

Time will normally tell if I had made the right purchase or not. I bought a pair of waterproof sneakers and an Allegra sandal which is versatile. They were kind enough to stretch the sneaker to make sure it wasn't bothering my bunion.

Food is fair. You order and you are given a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready. They use real dishes and silverware. The menu gives you a calorie count of each item you are purchasing.  One of the popular feature items is you pick two where you can have half a sandwich or salad or soup in a pair of two of those items. You also get with it a choice of an apple or roll and you can add a dessert for $1.00

I was disappointed to learn they had removed the French onion soup from the menu. I asked about this removal only to learn there was something wrong with one of the ingredients. The other disappointment was that this year they are not making gingerbread men which are one of my favorite holiday treats. Instead they are offering a holiday themed sugar cookie.

I normally eat here when I'm in a hurry and don't have time to sit down at a regular restaurant. They do use fresh breads and they do cater. You can also order your holiday baked goods or breads for your parties."	review	9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 1}	3.57	{u'profile': 1, u'cute': 1, u'funny': 1, u'plain': 65, u'writer': 22, u'note': 7, u'photos': 20, u'hot': 13, u'cool': 19}	[2014, 2015]	9	[Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, M-O0tasOl0SGiUsxdO5cZw, FP79xn8H2XXnMksRuP5l6A, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg, og1G5WbU6yT-MY_BRILKFA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, qWtBYHSW9heJXXRTqkaZRg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 4BWGVJEqqOnihPxnZbuEzQ, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, e7lJwGbdJsrFziQoXKNJ6w, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA, GMtILOfAHXUMrfMgLPG0gg, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, 2H-ibWQ3ok_LlUeb4SPiLw, J6-9Y2ZpPUjcoN2EH9aYlA, l_szjd-ken3ma6oHDkTYXg, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, 2UC3rwRm6swuNFt_GhKOhw, Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w, 6xS41eiB_7MHNjT411-0Cg, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ, mzG1ixWgZmgi8dcLARGlEw, iyNf5jr-34Bg6nKOGEZXKg, r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ, J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA, 6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA, bZpBAaxC0L9LzrQPUJF7ew, mdJZA5p391bCOZnvAxHV3w, s0qiS71nzMUmqBdM4oPc7Q, kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA, suRGJir2NmSZVnixdIN22Q, e1W6pOaJbovM-jEosgwOCw, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, csNALHN2BVA7hVgC9ge-VQ, 0P58MD0FRVI6pTVKUpd7YA, JsKvjx4Qiwvof8RV3luTrw, lAqoz5QTFxp3GDfpq0McRQ, 3_eHstHxLLwqarRifM_6PQ, f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA, wCJbSEmMeZ0mAnJRQEyfCQ, E62SZVU_FsbCYaVnMRs4TA, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA, Sjb5e5-gKoLXueFDMc2R8Q, bhZ13wN_5lQrKX278AP_aw, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, KSS6v5fcZNoelu4eEZCFcw, eR-Ay92e9ZAy4J3UfZvb3Q, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, RWSBzkqH2-lsQDH8gVBuEw, XwRyD7_pmXPugYH83fz7yA, 3klCtdbZ6NqaaqXXbcmBRg, Pe6o1SR3T98ONB_SXaHd6Q, jaQtFNFb6iX5kOVvmcu7Pg, tOm1mQutc-UW9H4ME1HToQ, hlpHSNcosmjXQ-gfGXFGRw, v3Zkgv-Re0aUYfmBAPa2ng, GC9ARGIiuJqUJSmVSMzA6w, UgPa7ByY6r7R9nQPC6HAyA, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, Z3pEOLUrG17cntPCFzruPg, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, tbulL35tvViEjm_nbUIE2g, adazKj0m2qJWEryQ2wbSCA, V3AKvUyVLlS1Bj1Qr4CN9g, y9Q2mHM8av_2fiqvvers-Q, VRB9nzZnYWB6WETk_QfIEQ, 2Az24juAhTJtmlqr5UWXSQ, L_1ldS4LQxCt7cVN1tfWAQ, yWSSnsbTeusmrASKB6h6Dg, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA, 0o7RNtR1IPmS-Z4crt8l5Q, X8JLvSlgfsnhfzb_lOzgbg, es9l0E8GJT4eWyCTSU4C2A, rONxiM8Hafy5kba3ZLoCbA]	Arlene	330	user	{u'funny': 135, u'useful': 580, u'cool': 428}	2013-02

The service is friendly and now they have added to your table a machine where you can play games, answer trivia questions, or add to your order. There is a slight fee for the two former items so you would swipe your card in order to use it.

I normally come here during the week when they have lunch specials. You get a choice or soup, half sandwich or half salad of the ones listed.

I normally order the French onion soup along with the Chinese chicken salad. Although it comes fried you can request it grilled and you get a small breadstick to go with it.

It is a smaller portion than regular size for the same items but since I don't eat a whole lot I find it to be enough. Food is okay. Prices are reasonable.

They have another option when you come at other times for a 2 party sharing meal which is listed on the menu. 

On this particular visit I noticed a young boy was celebrating a birthday so a group of waiters came gave him a small dessert and sang to him. Desserts are also reasonably priced but not overly big.

On this visit I was in the mood for a strawberry sundae. Line was short so didn't have to wait long. It comes in three sizes. I opted for the medium. Real strawberries added to the vanilla ice cream made it delicious!

On hot summer days be prepared for long lines let alone ice cream melting once served. This current stand is under renovation but is open during the process. It is a little tricky to park since it sits on the corner of a major intersection.

We had a very difficult time parking but managed to secure a spot on the street. After ""feeding the meter"" we went to the diner and learned that today and tomorrow they had free street parking due to July 4th holiday.

We laughed it off and were seated fairly promptly. The place is small and very crowded. Food is all homemade from scratch. My girlfriend opted for breakfast so she settled for a veggie omelet with toast and I chose a turkey Rachel. The sandwich came on marble bread and was filled with sauerkraut an cheese. It also came with potato pancakes. Portion sizes were generous and the food was very good.

They are noted for their pancakes which we will try on another visit. We got our meals rather quickly and our waitress was very attentive to our needs. There is an $8.00 minimum charge for credit cards and there is a sign telling you that you must tell them when you order whether or not to split your check.

The tables are topped with various advertisers and they have interesting things to observe while you wait for your meal.

My suggestion would be to come during off hours or non-holiday especially if you want to have a nice breakfast or lunch. They are only open until 3 in the afternoon.

Our group was seated in the main dining area across from a giant screen TV. Our leader asked if we could be seated elsewhere so that we could chat with one another. It was after 5 and the hostess said we could go to another room but we had to be out of there by 6:30. Everyone agreed.

The waitress came and took drink orders first.  When she went to serve us she spilled a beverage right over the table narrowly missing me but hit someone sitting diagonal to me  I thought this was a normal mishap and the area was cleaned up properly.

I was very hesitant about what I wanted to order and decided upon a vegetable salad. Our leader normally treats us to an appetizer and in this case it was chicken nachos. I tried one but could  not taste the chicken but otherwise it tasted okay.

Later when our waitress began serving our main courses I noticed she was spilling sauces on the floor before being placed in front of the guest. I was grateful I ordered a salad. It was nothing out of the ordinary but you could get this same salad anywhere. The person next to me ordered the beer battered giant fish sandwich. He offered me a piece to try and when I bit into it all I could taste was the beer batter. No fish. Enough said.

I was done with my meal and noticed it was 6:20 so I told the group it was time to get up and go so they could have this table.

This is certainly not a place I will go to on my own.

They specialize in both coffee and tea. They have the tea brands you would normally see in a grocery store.

They also sell items to press your coffee as well as tea infusers to name a few. In the back there is a take out area if you want to order coffee, tea, or a sweet snack to boot.

The place was so crowded that a man asked us if we were in line. Both of us couldn't tell since we saw two groups of people opposite each other. Since we were headed to see a show, my son did not want to wait around to order his coffee.

I really didn't get to try anything here but since I am familiar with the brands they carry it is nothing new than what you get at the grocery store. My son told me the coffee here is good so will have to check it out again on a future visit."	review	9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 4, u'cool': 2}	3.57	{u'profile': 1, u'cute': 1, u'funny': 1, u'plain': 65, u'writer': 22, u'note': 7, u'photos': 20, u'hot': 13, u'cool': 19}	[2014, 2015]	9	[Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, M-O0tasOl0SGiUsxdO5cZw, FP79xn8H2XXnMksRuP5l6A, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg, og1G5WbU6yT-MY_BRILKFA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, qWtBYHSW9heJXXRTqkaZRg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 4BWGVJEqqOnihPxnZbuEzQ, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, e7lJwGbdJsrFziQoXKNJ6w, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA, GMtILOfAHXUMrfMgLPG0gg, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, 2H-ibWQ3ok_LlUeb4SPiLw, J6-9Y2ZpPUjcoN2EH9aYlA, l_szjd-ken3ma6oHDkTYXg, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, 2UC3rwRm6swuNFt_GhKOhw, Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w, 6xS41eiB_7MHNjT411-0Cg, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ, mzG1ixWgZmgi8dcLARGlEw, iyNf5jr-34Bg6nKOGEZXKg, r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ, J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA, 6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA, bZpBAaxC0L9LzrQPUJF7ew, mdJZA5p391bCOZnvAxHV3w, s0qiS71nzMUmqBdM4oPc7Q, kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA, suRGJir2NmSZVnixdIN22Q, e1W6pOaJbovM-jEosgwOCw, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, csNALHN2BVA7hVgC9ge-VQ, 0P58MD0FRVI6pTVKUpd7YA, JsKvjx4Qiwvof8RV3luTrw, lAqoz5QTFxp3GDfpq0McRQ, 3_eHstHxLLwqarRifM_6PQ, f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA, wCJbSEmMeZ0mAnJRQEyfCQ, E62SZVU_FsbCYaVnMRs4TA, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA, Sjb5e5-gKoLXueFDMc2R8Q, bhZ13wN_5lQrKX278AP_aw, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, KSS6v5fcZNoelu4eEZCFcw, eR-Ay92e9ZAy4J3UfZvb3Q, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, RWSBzkqH2-lsQDH8gVBuEw, XwRyD7_pmXPugYH83fz7yA, 3klCtdbZ6NqaaqXXbcmBRg, Pe6o1SR3T98ONB_SXaHd6Q, jaQtFNFb6iX5kOVvmcu7Pg, tOm1mQutc-UW9H4ME1HToQ, hlpHSNcosmjXQ-gfGXFGRw, v3Zkgv-Re0aUYfmBAPa2ng, GC9ARGIiuJqUJSmVSMzA6w, UgPa7ByY6r7R9nQPC6HAyA, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, Z3pEOLUrG17cntPCFzruPg, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, tbulL35tvViEjm_nbUIE2g, adazKj0m2qJWEryQ2wbSCA, V3AKvUyVLlS1Bj1Qr4CN9g, y9Q2mHM8av_2fiqvvers-Q, VRB9nzZnYWB6WETk_QfIEQ, 2Az24juAhTJtmlqr5UWXSQ, L_1ldS4LQxCt7cVN1tfWAQ, yWSSnsbTeusmrASKB6h6Dg, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA, 0o7RNtR1IPmS-Z4crt8l5Q, X8JLvSlgfsnhfzb_lOzgbg, es9l0E8GJT4eWyCTSU4C2A, rONxiM8Hafy5kba3ZLoCbA]	Arlene	330	user	{u'funny': 135, u'useful': 580, u'cool': 428}	2013-02

Seating is half moon shaped so people sitting on the side can catch the ""action"" from a different point of view. There are two small balconies surrounding the theater. This theater is very strict regarding use of cell phones inside and we were advised that if anyone took a picture of the set to delete it immediately.

I came to see ""The Diary of Anne Frank"". This is the actual Broadway production that won a Tony back in the 1950s and is based off the writings of the diary itself. I had only seen the movie many years ago but never seen it performed live.

From the tearjerking beginning where Otto Frank is given Anne's diary from Miep Giles, the audience is transported back to 1942 where we meet both the Frank family and their close friends the Van Daan's. Remy Zaken plays the young spirited Anne Frank who despises her mother, greatly attached to her father, and runs in to conflict with the Van Daan's son Peter(excellently portrayed by David Edward Jackson).

The set replicates the tight quarters they had to share as well as the lack of food from rationing tickets. Every night they had variations of beans for dinner. Enter Daniel Krell as Mr. Dussell, a dentist who increases the party in hiding to 8 and is forced to share a room with Anne.

The conflicts with Anne and Mr. Dussell heighten as they each want time to themselves in the room. Amidst the fear of being found out Anne brings a positive spirit which is both quoted in the play from her dairy and at the end.

Anne writes ""In spite of everything, I still believe people are good at heart."" We are drawn to her warmth when near the close of Act 1 she gives home made Hanukkah gifts to everyone in the annex.

Act 2 finds Anne having gone through puberty and beginning to establish a fondness for Peter whom she was on the outs with earlier. Hope for a quick end of the war comes with Miep's announcement of D-Day but is quickly dashed when on Aug 4th, 1944 the annex is raided. The audience does not see the action but throughout the production background noises suggest an air raid, a thief entry, as well as the Gestapo breaking up the house in search of the families.

We are brought back to the beginning of the story where we learn Anne's fate. Only the father survived but the diary served as a legacy for generations to come of one of the best literary works of the Holocaust.

I had a great seat near the front so I felt like I was in the heart of the action. This production was one of the best I had ever seen and truly brought tears to my eyes. I highly recommend this show and am looking forward to future productions there."	review	9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 2}	3.57	{u'profile': 1, u'cute': 1, u'funny': 1, u'plain': 65, u'writer': 22, u'note': 7, u'photos': 20, u'hot': 13, u'cool': 19}	[2014, 2015]	9	[Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, M-O0tasOl0SGiUsxdO5cZw, FP79xn8H2XXnMksRuP5l6A, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg, og1G5WbU6yT-MY_BRILKFA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, qWtBYHSW9heJXXRTqkaZRg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 4BWGVJEqqOnihPxnZbuEzQ, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, e7lJwGbdJsrFziQoXKNJ6w, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA, GMtILOfAHXUMrfMgLPG0gg, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, 2H-ibWQ3ok_LlUeb4SPiLw, J6-9Y2ZpPUjcoN2EH9aYlA, l_szjd-ken3ma6oHDkTYXg, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, 2UC3rwRm6swuNFt_GhKOhw, Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w, 6xS41eiB_7MHNjT411-0Cg, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ, mzG1ixWgZmgi8dcLARGlEw, iyNf5jr-34Bg6nKOGEZXKg, r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ, J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA, 6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA, bZpBAaxC0L9LzrQPUJF7ew, mdJZA5p391bCOZnvAxHV3w, s0qiS71nzMUmqBdM4oPc7Q, kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA, suRGJir2NmSZVnixdIN22Q, e1W6pOaJbovM-jEosgwOCw, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, csNALHN2BVA7hVgC9ge-VQ, 0P58MD0FRVI6pTVKUpd7YA, JsKvjx4Qiwvof8RV3luTrw, lAqoz5QTFxp3GDfpq0McRQ, 3_eHstHxLLwqarRifM_6PQ, f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA, wCJbSEmMeZ0mAnJRQEyfCQ, E62SZVU_FsbCYaVnMRs4TA, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA, Sjb5e5-gKoLXueFDMc2R8Q, bhZ13wN_5lQrKX278AP_aw, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, KSS6v5fcZNoelu4eEZCFcw, eR-Ay92e9ZAy4J3UfZvb3Q, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, RWSBzkqH2-lsQDH8gVBuEw, XwRyD7_pmXPugYH83fz7yA, 3klCtdbZ6NqaaqXXbcmBRg, Pe6o1SR3T98ONB_SXaHd6Q, jaQtFNFb6iX5kOVvmcu7Pg, tOm1mQutc-UW9H4ME1HToQ, hlpHSNcosmjXQ-gfGXFGRw, v3Zkgv-Re0aUYfmBAPa2ng, GC9ARGIiuJqUJSmVSMzA6w, UgPa7ByY6r7R9nQPC6HAyA, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, Z3pEOLUrG17cntPCFzruPg, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, tbulL35tvViEjm_nbUIE2g, adazKj0m2qJWEryQ2wbSCA, V3AKvUyVLlS1Bj1Qr4CN9g, y9Q2mHM8av_2fiqvvers-Q, VRB9nzZnYWB6WETk_QfIEQ, 2Az24juAhTJtmlqr5UWXSQ, L_1ldS4LQxCt7cVN1tfWAQ, yWSSnsbTeusmrASKB6h6Dg, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA, 0o7RNtR1IPmS-Z4crt8l5Q, X8JLvSlgfsnhfzb_lOzgbg, es9l0E8GJT4eWyCTSU4C2A, rONxiM8Hafy5kba3ZLoCbA]	Arlene	330	user	{u'funny': 135, u'useful': 580, u'cool': 428}	2013-02

They even have a counter where you can have a box made up from looking through a glass shelf.

They have relativity cheap candy too if you just want some last minute stocking stuffers.  I asked a clerk for advice on what to get for my daughter who loves milk chocolate.

I've seen some of these musicals on the Broadway series in the cramped Broadway theaters themselves so it is refreshing to be able to see that same show from a larger venue.

It is true that if you have seats to the far right or left then you will miss both the scenery and what happens on that side of the stage but that is true with most any theater. I find that if I am unable to get good seats and must sit far away or in the balcony then I bring some ""opera"" glasses to help me get a close up of the stars and the action.

In addition to musical theater the Benedum Center offers special performances like the Nutcracker or special singers or groups depending upon the time of the year.

Normally the CLO now has this new gimmick going on where they will take a picture of you for free in front of a show marquee and then post it on Facebook so you can download the image.

It does have handicapped accessible access as well as free listening devices for the hearing impaired.

They do have narrow areas for gift shopping as well as for purchasing beverages and snacks on two of the levels along with the basement. On the first tier there are lounge areas where you can just relax before or during intermission. The rest room lines are long but move quickly enough so that you can return to your seat in time for the 2nd act.

They also offer some VIP packages where you get special ""perks"" along with better seating for more money. I am taking advantage of one of these perks next year and will update this review to see whether or not my investment was worth it.

Sadly however, they don't always inform you of special name entertainment unless you are a donor. I've missed out on a couple of these attractions for that reason. Still the ticket prices are way less than what you'd pay to see the same show on Broadway and I feel it is worth your money."	review	9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 1}	3.57	{u'profile': 1, u'cute': 1, u'funny': 1, u'plain': 65, u'writer': 22, u'note': 7, u'photos': 20, u'hot': 13, u'cool': 19}	[2014, 2015]	9	[Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, M-O0tasOl0SGiUsxdO5cZw, FP79xn8H2XXnMksRuP5l6A, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg, og1G5WbU6yT-MY_BRILKFA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, qWtBYHSW9heJXXRTqkaZRg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 4BWGVJEqqOnihPxnZbuEzQ, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, e7lJwGbdJsrFziQoXKNJ6w, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA, GMtILOfAHXUMrfMgLPG0gg, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, 2H-ibWQ3ok_LlUeb4SPiLw, J6-9Y2ZpPUjcoN2EH9aYlA, l_szjd-ken3ma6oHDkTYXg, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, 2UC3rwRm6swuNFt_GhKOhw, Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w, 6xS41eiB_7MHNjT411-0Cg, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ, mzG1ixWgZmgi8dcLARGlEw, iyNf5jr-34Bg6nKOGEZXKg, r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ, J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA, 6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA, bZpBAaxC0L9LzrQPUJF7ew, mdJZA5p391bCOZnvAxHV3w, s0qiS71nzMUmqBdM4oPc7Q, kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA, suRGJir2NmSZVnixdIN22Q, e1W6pOaJbovM-jEosgwOCw, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, csNALHN2BVA7hVgC9ge-VQ, 0P58MD0FRVI6pTVKUpd7YA, JsKvjx4Qiwvof8RV3luTrw, lAqoz5QTFxp3GDfpq0McRQ, 3_eHstHxLLwqarRifM_6PQ, f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA, wCJbSEmMeZ0mAnJRQEyfCQ, E62SZVU_FsbCYaVnMRs4TA, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA, Sjb5e5-gKoLXueFDMc2R8Q, bhZ13wN_5lQrKX278AP_aw, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, KSS6v5fcZNoelu4eEZCFcw, eR-Ay92e9ZAy4J3UfZvb3Q, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, RWSBzkqH2-lsQDH8gVBuEw, XwRyD7_pmXPugYH83fz7yA, 3klCtdbZ6NqaaqXXbcmBRg, Pe6o1SR3T98ONB_SXaHd6Q, jaQtFNFb6iX5kOVvmcu7Pg, tOm1mQutc-UW9H4ME1HToQ, hlpHSNcosmjXQ-gfGXFGRw, v3Zkgv-Re0aUYfmBAPa2ng, GC9ARGIiuJqUJSmVSMzA6w, UgPa7ByY6r7R9nQPC6HAyA, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, Z3pEOLUrG17cntPCFzruPg, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, tbulL35tvViEjm_nbUIE2g, adazKj0m2qJWEryQ2wbSCA, V3AKvUyVLlS1Bj1Qr4CN9g, y9Q2mHM8av_2fiqvvers-Q, VRB9nzZnYWB6WETk_QfIEQ, 2Az24juAhTJtmlqr5UWXSQ, L_1ldS4LQxCt7cVN1tfWAQ, yWSSnsbTeusmrASKB6h6Dg, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA, 0o7RNtR1IPmS-Z4crt8l5Q, X8JLvSlgfsnhfzb_lOzgbg, es9l0E8GJT4eWyCTSU4C2A, rONxiM8Hafy5kba3ZLoCbA]	Arlene	330	user	{u'funny': 135, u'useful': 580, u'cool': 428}	2013-02

Check them out if you get a chance!"	review	9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 2}	3.57	{u'profile': 1, u'cute': 1, u'funny': 1, u'plain': 65, u'writer': 22, u'note': 7, u'photos': 20, u'hot': 13, u'cool': 19}	[2014, 2015]	9	[Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, M-O0tasOl0SGiUsxdO5cZw, FP79xn8H2XXnMksRuP5l6A, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg, og1G5WbU6yT-MY_BRILKFA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, qWtBYHSW9heJXXRTqkaZRg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 4BWGVJEqqOnihPxnZbuEzQ, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, e7lJwGbdJsrFziQoXKNJ6w, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA, GMtILOfAHXUMrfMgLPG0gg, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, 2H-ibWQ3ok_LlUeb4SPiLw, J6-9Y2ZpPUjcoN2EH9aYlA, l_szjd-ken3ma6oHDkTYXg, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, 2UC3rwRm6swuNFt_GhKOhw, Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w, 6xS41eiB_7MHNjT411-0Cg, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ, mzG1ixWgZmgi8dcLARGlEw, iyNf5jr-34Bg6nKOGEZXKg, r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ, J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA, 6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA, bZpBAaxC0L9LzrQPUJF7ew, mdJZA5p391bCOZnvAxHV3w, s0qiS71nzMUmqBdM4oPc7Q, kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA, suRGJir2NmSZVnixdIN22Q, e1W6pOaJbovM-jEosgwOCw, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, csNALHN2BVA7hVgC9ge-VQ, 0P58MD0FRVI6pTVKUpd7YA, JsKvjx4Qiwvof8RV3luTrw, lAqoz5QTFxp3GDfpq0McRQ, 3_eHstHxLLwqarRifM_6PQ, f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA, wCJbSEmMeZ0mAnJRQEyfCQ, E62SZVU_FsbCYaVnMRs4TA, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA, Sjb5e5-gKoLXueFDMc2R8Q, bhZ13wN_5lQrKX278AP_aw, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, KSS6v5fcZNoelu4eEZCFcw, eR-Ay92e9ZAy4J3UfZvb3Q, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, RWSBzkqH2-lsQDH8gVBuEw, XwRyD7_pmXPugYH83fz7yA, 3klCtdbZ6NqaaqXXbcmBRg, Pe6o1SR3T98ONB_SXaHd6Q, jaQtFNFb6iX5kOVvmcu7Pg, tOm1mQutc-UW9H4ME1HToQ, hlpHSNcosmjXQ-gfGXFGRw, v3Zkgv-Re0aUYfmBAPa2ng, GC9ARGIiuJqUJSmVSMzA6w, UgPa7ByY6r7R9nQPC6HAyA, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, Z3pEOLUrG17cntPCFzruPg, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, tbulL35tvViEjm_nbUIE2g, adazKj0m2qJWEryQ2wbSCA, V3AKvUyVLlS1Bj1Qr4CN9g, y9Q2mHM8av_2fiqvvers-Q, VRB9nzZnYWB6WETk_QfIEQ, 2Az24juAhTJtmlqr5UWXSQ, L_1ldS4LQxCt7cVN1tfWAQ, yWSSnsbTeusmrASKB6h6Dg, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA, 0o7RNtR1IPmS-Z4crt8l5Q, X8JLvSlgfsnhfzb_lOzgbg, es9l0E8GJT4eWyCTSU4C2A, rONxiM8Hafy5kba3ZLoCbA]	Arlene	330	user	{u'funny': 135, u'useful': 580, u'cool': 428}	2013-02

The food was good and the presentation was fair. They had door prizes and afterwards you could talk about any issues.
I met with the service team regarding my upcoming apt and got my concerns resolved.
I still have trouble understanding my new vehicle. I waited until nearly everyone was gone to get a ""fast"" overview. I had to end up reading the owner's manual just to figure out how to turn things off.

On the overhaul picture however, I have dealt with this dealership before since I owned an car with them. They have a nice service department. Wifi and cellular service is bad although you can get wifi in the internet café.

They talked about schedulilng online. I am still having trouble with this feature and prefer to call. They do however do good work in maintaining my vehicle.

I only go there due to convenience to my home. They are good rated but after last night's event much leaves to be desired."	review	9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.57	{u'profile': 1, u'cute': 1, u'funny': 1, u'plain': 65, u'writer': 22, u'note': 7, u'photos': 20, u'hot': 13, u'cool': 19}	[2014, 2015]	9	[Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, M-O0tasOl0SGiUsxdO5cZw, FP79xn8H2XXnMksRuP5l6A, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg, og1G5WbU6yT-MY_BRILKFA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, qWtBYHSW9heJXXRTqkaZRg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 4BWGVJEqqOnihPxnZbuEzQ, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, e7lJwGbdJsrFziQoXKNJ6w, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA, GMtILOfAHXUMrfMgLPG0gg, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, 2H-ibWQ3ok_LlUeb4SPiLw, J6-9Y2ZpPUjcoN2EH9aYlA, l_szjd-ken3ma6oHDkTYXg, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, 2UC3rwRm6swuNFt_GhKOhw, Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w, 6xS41eiB_7MHNjT411-0Cg, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ, mzG1ixWgZmgi8dcLARGlEw, iyNf5jr-34Bg6nKOGEZXKg, r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ, J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA, 6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA, bZpBAaxC0L9LzrQPUJF7ew, mdJZA5p391bCOZnvAxHV3w, s0qiS71nzMUmqBdM4oPc7Q, kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA, suRGJir2NmSZVnixdIN22Q, e1W6pOaJbovM-jEosgwOCw, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, csNALHN2BVA7hVgC9ge-VQ, 0P58MD0FRVI6pTVKUpd7YA, JsKvjx4Qiwvof8RV3luTrw, lAqoz5QTFxp3GDfpq0McRQ, 3_eHstHxLLwqarRifM_6PQ, f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA, wCJbSEmMeZ0mAnJRQEyfCQ, E62SZVU_FsbCYaVnMRs4TA, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA, Sjb5e5-gKoLXueFDMc2R8Q, bhZ13wN_5lQrKX278AP_aw, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, KSS6v5fcZNoelu4eEZCFcw, eR-Ay92e9ZAy4J3UfZvb3Q, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, RWSBzkqH2-lsQDH8gVBuEw, XwRyD7_pmXPugYH83fz7yA, 3klCtdbZ6NqaaqXXbcmBRg, Pe6o1SR3T98ONB_SXaHd6Q, jaQtFNFb6iX5kOVvmcu7Pg, tOm1mQutc-UW9H4ME1HToQ, hlpHSNcosmjXQ-gfGXFGRw, v3Zkgv-Re0aUYfmBAPa2ng, GC9ARGIiuJqUJSmVSMzA6w, UgPa7ByY6r7R9nQPC6HAyA, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, Z3pEOLUrG17cntPCFzruPg, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, tbulL35tvViEjm_nbUIE2g, adazKj0m2qJWEryQ2wbSCA, V3AKvUyVLlS1Bj1Qr4CN9g, y9Q2mHM8av_2fiqvvers-Q, VRB9nzZnYWB6WETk_QfIEQ, 2Az24juAhTJtmlqr5UWXSQ, L_1ldS4LQxCt7cVN1tfWAQ, yWSSnsbTeusmrASKB6h6Dg, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA, 0o7RNtR1IPmS-Z4crt8l5Q, X8JLvSlgfsnhfzb_lOzgbg, es9l0E8GJT4eWyCTSU4C2A, rONxiM8Hafy5kba3ZLoCbA]	Arlene	330	user	{u'funny': 135, u'useful': 580, u'cool': 428}	2013-02

I've been to them before and what differences them from regular Giant Eagle stores is that they normally have a wider selection of fresh food, a bakery department, and an area where you can purchase ready made food or a salad bar and eat inside or out.

Prices are typically higher than other grocery stores but the same as if you were looking for the same item at a regular Giant Eagle.

I normally stop here only if there's something specific I need that I cannot find at my local store.

I normally order the French onion soup and pair it with a salad and it works quite well for me. They do serve it with a bread-stick which I always enjoy Service is good and waitress attentive. 

They do offer a full size menu and of course there is a bar menu. They have free Wi Fi available and manage to make your visit enjoyable.

Wagner's carries better quality shoes along with orthotics if you need them for arch support. They carry most of the same line as a competitor I visit in Homestead and they have the stand on device to determine your arch.

The sales people were busy with other customers so i didn't want to disturb them. I looked around and saw they were basically the same shoe brands carried in Homestead. You will find Ugg, Merrill, Aravon, Clarks, and New Balance to name a few. The have separate sides for men's and ladies shoes.

Since I had just purchased a new pair of walking shoes I'm not in the market for another pair at present. I'm sure the next time I visit depending upon the service they provide me I will give this place a higher rating.

The two of us usually come in with her list of required supplies and most of the stock is on hand for them to get or order. The staff has always been friendly and helpful in finding us the best priced items or comparable to her needs. The thing I like most is that even though it is a bit costly it beats a campus bookstore hands down.

My daughter has found many things in this store which has helped her in the past and she continues to find things. This visit focused on her painting class and we were able to obtain the majority of her items needed and still save quite a bit of money with her discount. 

Located in the Southside there is a pay outdoor parking lot in the next block which makes it easy for us to park and visit.

Sometimes she will receive coupons in the mail and sometimes they will offer back to school specials especially as the fall semester begins.

Normally they are priced higher than your average grocery store. They do offer coupons on your receipt or on occasion you can get 20% provided you use it over a certain weekend.

What frustrates me most is having to wait for medication because of my plan. I obtain new prescriptions and then I'm told that it is too soon to fill because there is supposedly more pills on my expired one. Yesterday I was told by my doctor that she would overwrite one I needed for personal reasons and again I see I can't fill it because they have the old refill in place which should have been eradicated.

I do plan to have this matter addressed with my prescription plan on how they expect me to go on if I don't have enough medication and a new script is sitting there.

Other than that they are are just your everyday pharmacy and like a convenience store expect to pay more for items you need in a hurry."	review	9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 1}	3.57	{u'profile': 1, u'cute': 1, u'funny': 1, u'plain': 65, u'writer': 22, u'note': 7, u'photos': 20, u'hot': 13, u'cool': 19}	[2014, 2015]	9	[Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, M-O0tasOl0SGiUsxdO5cZw, FP79xn8H2XXnMksRuP5l6A, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg, og1G5WbU6yT-MY_BRILKFA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, qWtBYHSW9heJXXRTqkaZRg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 4BWGVJEqqOnihPxnZbuEzQ, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, e7lJwGbdJsrFziQoXKNJ6w, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA, GMtILOfAHXUMrfMgLPG0gg, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, 2H-ibWQ3ok_LlUeb4SPiLw, J6-9Y2ZpPUjcoN2EH9aYlA, l_szjd-ken3ma6oHDkTYXg, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, 2UC3rwRm6swuNFt_GhKOhw, Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w, 6xS41eiB_7MHNjT411-0Cg, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ, mzG1ixWgZmgi8dcLARGlEw, iyNf5jr-34Bg6nKOGEZXKg, r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ, J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA, 6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA, bZpBAaxC0L9LzrQPUJF7ew, mdJZA5p391bCOZnvAxHV3w, s0qiS71nzMUmqBdM4oPc7Q, kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA, suRGJir2NmSZVnixdIN22Q, e1W6pOaJbovM-jEosgwOCw, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, csNALHN2BVA7hVgC9ge-VQ, 0P58MD0FRVI6pTVKUpd7YA, JsKvjx4Qiwvof8RV3luTrw, lAqoz5QTFxp3GDfpq0McRQ, 3_eHstHxLLwqarRifM_6PQ, f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA, wCJbSEmMeZ0mAnJRQEyfCQ, E62SZVU_FsbCYaVnMRs4TA, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA, Sjb5e5-gKoLXueFDMc2R8Q, bhZ13wN_5lQrKX278AP_aw, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, KSS6v5fcZNoelu4eEZCFcw, eR-Ay92e9ZAy4J3UfZvb3Q, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, RWSBzkqH2-lsQDH8gVBuEw, XwRyD7_pmXPugYH83fz7yA, 3klCtdbZ6NqaaqXXbcmBRg, Pe6o1SR3T98ONB_SXaHd6Q, jaQtFNFb6iX5kOVvmcu7Pg, tOm1mQutc-UW9H4ME1HToQ, hlpHSNcosmjXQ-gfGXFGRw, v3Zkgv-Re0aUYfmBAPa2ng, GC9ARGIiuJqUJSmVSMzA6w, UgPa7ByY6r7R9nQPC6HAyA, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, Z3pEOLUrG17cntPCFzruPg, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, tbulL35tvViEjm_nbUIE2g, adazKj0m2qJWEryQ2wbSCA, V3AKvUyVLlS1Bj1Qr4CN9g, y9Q2mHM8av_2fiqvvers-Q, VRB9nzZnYWB6WETk_QfIEQ, 2Az24juAhTJtmlqr5UWXSQ, L_1ldS4LQxCt7cVN1tfWAQ, yWSSnsbTeusmrASKB6h6Dg, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA, 0o7RNtR1IPmS-Z4crt8l5Q, X8JLvSlgfsnhfzb_lOzgbg, es9l0E8GJT4eWyCTSU4C2A, rONxiM8Hafy5kba3ZLoCbA]	Arlene	330	user	{u'funny': 135, u'useful': 580, u'cool': 428}	2013-02
761	UAld9WNG9EQYayYp2d1cqw	2015-09-02	80zbmpxLeuqLLTvU_iXOCw	4	"I have been going to Ryan Automotive (part of the Goodyear chain) for years now when I need tires. A year ago on a trip my car hit a road hazard and totally destroyed one of my tires which was only a year old.

I was able to get it to their local Goodyear store and ended up getting two replacements. That store in Ohio gave me back the mate to that tire in case I could use it as a spare. Unfortunately, that was not the case since the the trunk has no room for it and I would have to pay to have it mounted.

Just recently I had my car in for routine service and learned that my remaining two original tires were soon to be in need of replacement. I decided to avoid the winter rush and made an apt with Ryan. They were able to get my tires to match and I purchased the same tire coverage which I had done in Ohio. It provides repair should you have a flat and if the tire is damaged they will prorate the value of a replacement tire for you.

Ryan automotive also offers other  car services similar to dealerships and from time to time has specials. Since it is just up the street from where I live, it is convenient for me to drop it off and wait for them to call me when the work is done. They even got rid of that extra tire i had from the original since I knew matching a year old tire against a new one was going to invite trouble. 

Ryan told me to keep the Ohio protection plan receipt in with their receipt from today so that in case of a mishap they could both service and identify which tire is affected. So far I've been pleased with the services they offer me as well as the convenience of being close to home."	review	9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 2}	3.57	{u'profile': 1, u'cute': 1, u'funny': 1, u'plain': 65, u'writer': 22, u'note': 7, u'photos': 20, u'hot': 13, u'cool': 19}	[2014, 2015]	9	[Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, M-O0tasOl0SGiUsxdO5cZw, FP79xn8H2XXnMksRuP5l6A, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg, og1G5WbU6yT-MY_BRILKFA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, qWtBYHSW9heJXXRTqkaZRg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 4BWGVJEqqOnihPxnZbuEzQ, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, e7lJwGbdJsrFziQoXKNJ6w, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA, GMtILOfAHXUMrfMgLPG0gg, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, 2H-ibWQ3ok_LlUeb4SPiLw, J6-9Y2ZpPUjcoN2EH9aYlA, l_szjd-ken3ma6oHDkTYXg, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, 2UC3rwRm6swuNFt_GhKOhw, Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w, 6xS41eiB_7MHNjT411-0Cg, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ, mzG1ixWgZmgi8dcLARGlEw, iyNf5jr-34Bg6nKOGEZXKg, r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ, J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA, 6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA, bZpBAaxC0L9LzrQPUJF7ew, mdJZA5p391bCOZnvAxHV3w, s0qiS71nzMUmqBdM4oPc7Q, kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA, suRGJir2NmSZVnixdIN22Q, e1W6pOaJbovM-jEosgwOCw, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, csNALHN2BVA7hVgC9ge-VQ, 0P58MD0FRVI6pTVKUpd7YA, JsKvjx4Qiwvof8RV3luTrw, lAqoz5QTFxp3GDfpq0McRQ, 3_eHstHxLLwqarRifM_6PQ, f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA, wCJbSEmMeZ0mAnJRQEyfCQ, E62SZVU_FsbCYaVnMRs4TA, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA, Sjb5e5-gKoLXueFDMc2R8Q, bhZ13wN_5lQrKX278AP_aw, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, KSS6v5fcZNoelu4eEZCFcw, eR-Ay92e9ZAy4J3UfZvb3Q, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, RWSBzkqH2-lsQDH8gVBuEw, XwRyD7_pmXPugYH83fz7yA, 3klCtdbZ6NqaaqXXbcmBRg, Pe6o1SR3T98ONB_SXaHd6Q, jaQtFNFb6iX5kOVvmcu7Pg, tOm1mQutc-UW9H4ME1HToQ, hlpHSNcosmjXQ-gfGXFGRw, v3Zkgv-Re0aUYfmBAPa2ng, GC9ARGIiuJqUJSmVSMzA6w, UgPa7ByY6r7R9nQPC6HAyA, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, Z3pEOLUrG17cntPCFzruPg, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, tbulL35tvViEjm_nbUIE2g, adazKj0m2qJWEryQ2wbSCA, V3AKvUyVLlS1Bj1Qr4CN9g, y9Q2mHM8av_2fiqvvers-Q, VRB9nzZnYWB6WETk_QfIEQ, 2Az24juAhTJtmlqr5UWXSQ, L_1ldS4LQxCt7cVN1tfWAQ, yWSSnsbTeusmrASKB6h6Dg, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA, 0o7RNtR1IPmS-Z4crt8l5Q, X8JLvSlgfsnhfzb_lOzgbg, es9l0E8GJT4eWyCTSU4C2A, rONxiM8Hafy5kba3ZLoCbA]	Arlene	330	user	{u'funny': 135, u'useful': 580, u'cool': 428}	2013-02

There is metered parking on that street and again I was able to secure a spot. The bakery is very small but it shows its French authenticity by displaying an Eiffel Tower inside. There is no indoor seating. It is pretty much order and go.

They have added to their selection quiche with two desserts for $23.00. Since I had heard so much about the Kouign amani, I ordered one for myself and one for my best friend who was at work. I asked them to box it for me which they did so it would retain its freshness.

I also decided to order a dozen macaroons and split in half so both of us could sample some of the different varieties. I ordered for us raspberry balsamic, rose raspberry, vanilla bean, lemon, chocolate, and marzipan. The lady told me that they can be refrigerated but to take them out and put them at room temperature for 5 minutes before eating. They also had samples of the Breton cake so I tried one and it was melt in your mouth goodness. Again I purchased one of these to split with her since you can eat it as is or put various toppings of your choice on it. They Breton cake is basically known as French shortbread and sells for $8.00.
A dozen macaroons sell for $19.00 which is a bit cheaper than purchasing individually.

The rest of the baked goods were refrigerated that included almond tortes, eclairs, sliced cakes as well as multiple servings of dessert pastries. You can call and order ahead if you know specifically what you wish to purchase.

I completed my purchase and returned to my car to eat the kouign amani. It was light and flaky and of course messy since I forgot to grab a napkin when I left. However, it was one of the best pastries I ever tasted!!  I am saving the macaroons for another day but I'm sure I won't be disappointed in my choice. 

This is also a great French bakery tucked away in Millvale. I'm sure my friend will want to check it out once I give her the items I bought for her and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to try a piece of Paris!"	review	9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 4, u'cool': 3}	3.57	{u'profile': 1, u'cute': 1, u'funny': 1, u'plain': 65, u'writer': 22, u'note': 7, u'photos': 20, u'hot': 13, u'cool': 19}	[2014, 2015]	9	[Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, M-O0tasOl0SGiUsxdO5cZw, FP79xn8H2XXnMksRuP5l6A, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg, og1G5WbU6yT-MY_BRILKFA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, qWtBYHSW9heJXXRTqkaZRg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 4BWGVJEqqOnihPxnZbuEzQ, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, e7lJwGbdJsrFziQoXKNJ6w, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA, GMtILOfAHXUMrfMgLPG0gg, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, 2H-ibWQ3ok_LlUeb4SPiLw, J6-9Y2ZpPUjcoN2EH9aYlA, l_szjd-ken3ma6oHDkTYXg, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, 2UC3rwRm6swuNFt_GhKOhw, Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w, 6xS41eiB_7MHNjT411-0Cg, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ, mzG1ixWgZmgi8dcLARGlEw, iyNf5jr-34Bg6nKOGEZXKg, r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ, J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA, 6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA, bZpBAaxC0L9LzrQPUJF7ew, mdJZA5p391bCOZnvAxHV3w, s0qiS71nzMUmqBdM4oPc7Q, kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA, suRGJir2NmSZVnixdIN22Q, e1W6pOaJbovM-jEosgwOCw, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, csNALHN2BVA7hVgC9ge-VQ, 0P58MD0FRVI6pTVKUpd7YA, JsKvjx4Qiwvof8RV3luTrw, lAqoz5QTFxp3GDfpq0McRQ, 3_eHstHxLLwqarRifM_6PQ, f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA, wCJbSEmMeZ0mAnJRQEyfCQ, E62SZVU_FsbCYaVnMRs4TA, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA, Sjb5e5-gKoLXueFDMc2R8Q, bhZ13wN_5lQrKX278AP_aw, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, KSS6v5fcZNoelu4eEZCFcw, eR-Ay92e9ZAy4J3UfZvb3Q, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, RWSBzkqH2-lsQDH8gVBuEw, XwRyD7_pmXPugYH83fz7yA, 3klCtdbZ6NqaaqXXbcmBRg, Pe6o1SR3T98ONB_SXaHd6Q, jaQtFNFb6iX5kOVvmcu7Pg, tOm1mQutc-UW9H4ME1HToQ, hlpHSNcosmjXQ-gfGXFGRw, v3Zkgv-Re0aUYfmBAPa2ng, GC9ARGIiuJqUJSmVSMzA6w, UgPa7ByY6r7R9nQPC6HAyA, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, Z3pEOLUrG17cntPCFzruPg, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, tbulL35tvViEjm_nbUIE2g, adazKj0m2qJWEryQ2wbSCA, V3AKvUyVLlS1Bj1Qr4CN9g, y9Q2mHM8av_2fiqvvers-Q, VRB9nzZnYWB6WETk_QfIEQ, 2Az24juAhTJtmlqr5UWXSQ, L_1ldS4LQxCt7cVN1tfWAQ, yWSSnsbTeusmrASKB6h6Dg, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA, 0o7RNtR1IPmS-Z4crt8l5Q, X8JLvSlgfsnhfzb_lOzgbg, es9l0E8GJT4eWyCTSU4C2A, rONxiM8Hafy5kba3ZLoCbA]	Arlene	330	user	{u'funny': 135, u'useful': 580, u'cool': 428}	2013-02

We started off with a glass of wine. I had the signature crab cakes with a side of asparagus and red peppers. My girlfriend ordered the surf and turf. Both meals were exceptionally delicious. We had bread with our meal as well. Please note that everything here is ala carte and there is no Wi Fi. Valet parking is $6.00. There is no self parking.

Before I ordered dessert the waiter told me it was on the house and I ordered a while chocolate mousse with praline cookies. It came with a candle and two plates for us to share. It was very good. We sat at a table that overlooked the city and had pictures taken.

Dr. Lowell Lebowitz continues to give quality eye care for his former patients and has added another doctor part time to the practice. I have been going here for years and am still pleased with their work

On my last visit I was given a thorough examination. The doctor is very clear concerning my vision needs and they have even more advanced equipment than my previous visit. You can now schedule online as well.

I have learned that I can get glasses a bit cheaper than using my vision plan which is what I intend to do when I return in 2015.

You can walk in if you need adjustments but for the most part you will need to schedule an apt if you have a concern or need an exam.

The optomap usually not included in the cost of the exam is a worthwhile test in that it exams the entire health of your eyes. It is voluntary and there is no obligation.

Again keep in mind it is located in downtown PIttsburgh so please keep that in mind when parking or having to deal with rush hour when scheduling."	review	9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.57	{u'profile': 1, u'cute': 1, u'funny': 1, u'plain': 65, u'writer': 22, u'note': 7, u'photos': 20, u'hot': 13, u'cool': 19}	[2014, 2015]	9	[Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, M-O0tasOl0SGiUsxdO5cZw, FP79xn8H2XXnMksRuP5l6A, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg, og1G5WbU6yT-MY_BRILKFA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, qWtBYHSW9heJXXRTqkaZRg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 4BWGVJEqqOnihPxnZbuEzQ, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, e7lJwGbdJsrFziQoXKNJ6w, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA, GMtILOfAHXUMrfMgLPG0gg, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, 2H-ibWQ3ok_LlUeb4SPiLw, J6-9Y2ZpPUjcoN2EH9aYlA, l_szjd-ken3ma6oHDkTYXg, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, 2UC3rwRm6swuNFt_GhKOhw, Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w, 6xS41eiB_7MHNjT411-0Cg, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ, mzG1ixWgZmgi8dcLARGlEw, iyNf5jr-34Bg6nKOGEZXKg, r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ, J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA, 6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA, bZpBAaxC0L9LzrQPUJF7ew, mdJZA5p391bCOZnvAxHV3w, s0qiS71nzMUmqBdM4oPc7Q, kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA, suRGJir2NmSZVnixdIN22Q, e1W6pOaJbovM-jEosgwOCw, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, csNALHN2BVA7hVgC9ge-VQ, 0P58MD0FRVI6pTVKUpd7YA, JsKvjx4Qiwvof8RV3luTrw, lAqoz5QTFxp3GDfpq0McRQ, 3_eHstHxLLwqarRifM_6PQ, f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA, wCJbSEmMeZ0mAnJRQEyfCQ, E62SZVU_FsbCYaVnMRs4TA, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA, Sjb5e5-gKoLXueFDMc2R8Q, bhZ13wN_5lQrKX278AP_aw, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, KSS6v5fcZNoelu4eEZCFcw, eR-Ay92e9ZAy4J3UfZvb3Q, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, RWSBzkqH2-lsQDH8gVBuEw, XwRyD7_pmXPugYH83fz7yA, 3klCtdbZ6NqaaqXXbcmBRg, Pe6o1SR3T98ONB_SXaHd6Q, jaQtFNFb6iX5kOVvmcu7Pg, tOm1mQutc-UW9H4ME1HToQ, hlpHSNcosmjXQ-gfGXFGRw, v3Zkgv-Re0aUYfmBAPa2ng, GC9ARGIiuJqUJSmVSMzA6w, UgPa7ByY6r7R9nQPC6HAyA, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, Z3pEOLUrG17cntPCFzruPg, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, tbulL35tvViEjm_nbUIE2g, adazKj0m2qJWEryQ2wbSCA, V3AKvUyVLlS1Bj1Qr4CN9g, y9Q2mHM8av_2fiqvvers-Q, VRB9nzZnYWB6WETk_QfIEQ, 2Az24juAhTJtmlqr5UWXSQ, L_1ldS4LQxCt7cVN1tfWAQ, yWSSnsbTeusmrASKB6h6Dg, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA, 0o7RNtR1IPmS-Z4crt8l5Q, X8JLvSlgfsnhfzb_lOzgbg, es9l0E8GJT4eWyCTSU4C2A, rONxiM8Hafy5kba3ZLoCbA]	Arlene	330	user	{u'funny': 135, u'useful': 580, u'cool': 428}	2013-02

I like the fact that when you walk in they measure your feet and then ask you to take a short walk back and forth in order to help determine the style of shoe best suited for your foot.

Most of the shoes they offer are for running which I can no longer do. I was told that some of them can be adapted for cross training which I desperately need when I do my workouts at the gym. They offer orthotics, heel inserts, and other items to help with comfort and support. 

Fleet feet also carries socks, fitness apparel, foundations for women and some items which you can use in your workouts. Lines they carry include Brooks, Saucony, Asics, and Nike to name a few.

Customer service is good and they do have a rewards program depending upon your spend and once you receive an award you have a certain time frame in which to use it. Located in a small strip mall across from Village Square, they are open pretty much all the time. They do have special events for runners as well as events if you sign up on their e-mail list.

Keep in mind these shoes are pricey but remember you get what you pay for. Sometimes it is worth paying a little extra if my shoes will last me longer than 6 months."	review	9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 2}	3.57	{u'profile': 1, u'cute': 1, u'funny': 1, u'plain': 65, u'writer': 22, u'note': 7, u'photos': 20, u'hot': 13, u'cool': 19}	[2014, 2015]	9	[Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, M-O0tasOl0SGiUsxdO5cZw, FP79xn8H2XXnMksRuP5l6A, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg, og1G5WbU6yT-MY_BRILKFA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, qWtBYHSW9heJXXRTqkaZRg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 4BWGVJEqqOnihPxnZbuEzQ, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, e7lJwGbdJsrFziQoXKNJ6w, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA, GMtILOfAHXUMrfMgLPG0gg, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, 2H-ibWQ3ok_LlUeb4SPiLw, J6-9Y2ZpPUjcoN2EH9aYlA, l_szjd-ken3ma6oHDkTYXg, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, 2UC3rwRm6swuNFt_GhKOhw, Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w, 6xS41eiB_7MHNjT411-0Cg, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ, mzG1ixWgZmgi8dcLARGlEw, iyNf5jr-34Bg6nKOGEZXKg, r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ, J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA, 6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA, bZpBAaxC0L9LzrQPUJF7ew, mdJZA5p391bCOZnvAxHV3w, s0qiS71nzMUmqBdM4oPc7Q, kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA, suRGJir2NmSZVnixdIN22Q, e1W6pOaJbovM-jEosgwOCw, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, csNALHN2BVA7hVgC9ge-VQ, 0P58MD0FRVI6pTVKUpd7YA, JsKvjx4Qiwvof8RV3luTrw, lAqoz5QTFxp3GDfpq0McRQ, 3_eHstHxLLwqarRifM_6PQ, f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA, wCJbSEmMeZ0mAnJRQEyfCQ, E62SZVU_FsbCYaVnMRs4TA, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA, Sjb5e5-gKoLXueFDMc2R8Q, bhZ13wN_5lQrKX278AP_aw, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, KSS6v5fcZNoelu4eEZCFcw, eR-Ay92e9ZAy4J3UfZvb3Q, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, RWSBzkqH2-lsQDH8gVBuEw, XwRyD7_pmXPugYH83fz7yA, 3klCtdbZ6NqaaqXXbcmBRg, Pe6o1SR3T98ONB_SXaHd6Q, jaQtFNFb6iX5kOVvmcu7Pg, tOm1mQutc-UW9H4ME1HToQ, hlpHSNcosmjXQ-gfGXFGRw, v3Zkgv-Re0aUYfmBAPa2ng, GC9ARGIiuJqUJSmVSMzA6w, UgPa7ByY6r7R9nQPC6HAyA, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, Z3pEOLUrG17cntPCFzruPg, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, tbulL35tvViEjm_nbUIE2g, adazKj0m2qJWEryQ2wbSCA, V3AKvUyVLlS1Bj1Qr4CN9g, y9Q2mHM8av_2fiqvvers-Q, VRB9nzZnYWB6WETk_QfIEQ, 2Az24juAhTJtmlqr5UWXSQ, L_1ldS4LQxCt7cVN1tfWAQ, yWSSnsbTeusmrASKB6h6Dg, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA, 0o7RNtR1IPmS-Z4crt8l5Q, X8JLvSlgfsnhfzb_lOzgbg, es9l0E8GJT4eWyCTSU4C2A, rONxiM8Hafy5kba3ZLoCbA]	Arlene	330	user	{u'funny': 135, u'useful': 580, u'cool': 428}	2013-02

We got the first time spot for the day chosen. I was thrilled with the fact that I didn't need to bring my marriage license. Many places in Las Vegas require your marriage license if you want to renew vows.
We were picked up right on time in our limo and driven straight up there. I had time to ""add final touches"" and then have the ceremony. ""Elvis"" escorted me down the aisle, performed the ceremony complete with the hilarious vows and did snippets of three Hawaiian numbers.
I had purchased a couple of ""extras"" such as the red cloth Elvis draped on me during the ceremony and a photo frame. We posed for pictures afterwards and then the limo had us back at our hotel within a matter of minutes.
The photos were expensive but worth it. My professional bridal photographer was also expensive when I was married.
The staff was very warm and friendly and helped make my 2nd most important day a day I will always cherish."	review	9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.57	{u'profile': 1, u'cute': 1, u'funny': 1, u'plain': 65, u'writer': 22, u'note': 7, u'photos': 20, u'hot': 13, u'cool': 19}	[2014, 2015]	9	[Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, M-O0tasOl0SGiUsxdO5cZw, FP79xn8H2XXnMksRuP5l6A, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg, og1G5WbU6yT-MY_BRILKFA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, qWtBYHSW9heJXXRTqkaZRg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 4BWGVJEqqOnihPxnZbuEzQ, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, e7lJwGbdJsrFziQoXKNJ6w, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA, GMtILOfAHXUMrfMgLPG0gg, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, 2H-ibWQ3ok_LlUeb4SPiLw, J6-9Y2ZpPUjcoN2EH9aYlA, l_szjd-ken3ma6oHDkTYXg, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, 2UC3rwRm6swuNFt_GhKOhw, Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w, 6xS41eiB_7MHNjT411-0Cg, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ, mzG1ixWgZmgi8dcLARGlEw, iyNf5jr-34Bg6nKOGEZXKg, r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ, J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA, 6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA, bZpBAaxC0L9LzrQPUJF7ew, mdJZA5p391bCOZnvAxHV3w, s0qiS71nzMUmqBdM4oPc7Q, kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA, suRGJir2NmSZVnixdIN22Q, e1W6pOaJbovM-jEosgwOCw, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, csNALHN2BVA7hVgC9ge-VQ, 0P58MD0FRVI6pTVKUpd7YA, JsKvjx4Qiwvof8RV3luTrw, lAqoz5QTFxp3GDfpq0McRQ, 3_eHstHxLLwqarRifM_6PQ, f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA, wCJbSEmMeZ0mAnJRQEyfCQ, E62SZVU_FsbCYaVnMRs4TA, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA, Sjb5e5-gKoLXueFDMc2R8Q, bhZ13wN_5lQrKX278AP_aw, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, KSS6v5fcZNoelu4eEZCFcw, eR-Ay92e9ZAy4J3UfZvb3Q, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, RWSBzkqH2-lsQDH8gVBuEw, XwRyD7_pmXPugYH83fz7yA, 3klCtdbZ6NqaaqXXbcmBRg, Pe6o1SR3T98ONB_SXaHd6Q, jaQtFNFb6iX5kOVvmcu7Pg, tOm1mQutc-UW9H4ME1HToQ, hlpHSNcosmjXQ-gfGXFGRw, v3Zkgv-Re0aUYfmBAPa2ng, GC9ARGIiuJqUJSmVSMzA6w, UgPa7ByY6r7R9nQPC6HAyA, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, Z3pEOLUrG17cntPCFzruPg, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, tbulL35tvViEjm_nbUIE2g, adazKj0m2qJWEryQ2wbSCA, V3AKvUyVLlS1Bj1Qr4CN9g, y9Q2mHM8av_2fiqvvers-Q, VRB9nzZnYWB6WETk_QfIEQ, 2Az24juAhTJtmlqr5UWXSQ, L_1ldS4LQxCt7cVN1tfWAQ, yWSSnsbTeusmrASKB6h6Dg, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA, 0o7RNtR1IPmS-Z4crt8l5Q, X8JLvSlgfsnhfzb_lOzgbg, es9l0E8GJT4eWyCTSU4C2A, rONxiM8Hafy5kba3ZLoCbA]	Arlene	330	user	{u'funny': 135, u'useful': 580, u'cool': 428}	2013-02
770	BacrktTHhhr_LRXCJY_S-w	2015-07-28	3FWTIZkGvckSmCTlXsvukQ	4	"Kennywood park has been a longstanding Pittsburgh tradition of amusement parks. School picnics are held here. Special events including the yearly fall fantasy of bands and parades also are a big draw.

Kennywood park is one of the few remaining amusement parks that offer not only tiered admission but also a ""nightrider"" pass of $26.99 if arriving after 5:00. Discount tickets coupons are also available at local Giant Eagle stores for weekday admission. Senior citizen rates start at age 55.

Kennywood still has picnic tables which has been a longstanding tradition of families bringing food into the park for an event or family gathering.

You are no longer issued wristbands upon entering once you pass the security checkpoint.  Rides are clearly indicated with restrictions and a bar is used to certify height requirements for children.

Kennywood still has their famous iconic rides and eateries, of the latter, the potato patch is the most popular. The train ride has been revamped to give you a pictorial history of the park. The Merry Go Round is the center of its classic elegance and the famous meeting place for friends. Noah's Ark still remains as their trademark walk through dark ride and the famous Thunderbolt, once known as the ""king of the coasters"" provides a thrill seeking ride for those who love wooden coasters. Also among ""hidden"" icons is the famous ""Old Mill"" boat ride which has been remodeled to Garfield's nightmare.

Kennywood offers something for everyone in your family. For thrill seekers, coasters such as ""the Phantom's revenge"" along with Racer and Jack Rabbit offer fun and excitement. There are other thrill rides my personal favorite being the Black widow which is a pendulum style ride where about 50 people sit in a rotating circle as it sways back and forth to extremely high levels!

Kennywood does offer a VIP pass if you wish to purchase it to avoid the lines for coasters only. During weekdays the lines for these rides are not as bad so you can plan your day accordingly.

They have an area called ""Lost Kennywood"" to reflect an era from our grandparent's generation. The park was founded in 1898. Kiddieland is available to small children wanting to ride a miniature version of some of the big named rides. You can see some of it from the train ride.

Water rides like the ""Pittsburgh plunge"" cool you off on an excessive hot day but I see they have now installed pay for drying stations if you don't want to walk around totally soaked.

They are in the process of opening a 4D theater within the week called ""the Ice age"".  All I could see was that it does require 3D glasses.

Food, ice cream, and treats are everywhere. There are two indoor restaurants-the Parkside cafeteria and Johnny Rockets (will be reviewed separately). Handicapped access is also available at most of the rides as well as lockers. Please note you can ""stow"" your gear before boarding certain rides but you do so at your own risk..

They also have daily shows along with plenty of park benches to rest. If you look around you can find more of Kennywood's history such as the historic windmill. Landmark signs point them out. More information about the park can be found on their website.

Finally they will offer rain checks in the event of inclement weather under certain guidelines. Kennywood is a timeless tradition for Pittsburgh and I hope to visit again."	review	9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 2}	3.57	{u'profile': 1, u'cute': 1, u'funny': 1, u'plain': 65, u'writer': 22, u'note': 7, u'photos': 20, u'hot': 13, u'cool': 19}	[2014, 2015]	9	[Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg, AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g, M-O0tasOl0SGiUsxdO5cZw, FP79xn8H2XXnMksRuP5l6A, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg, og1G5WbU6yT-MY_BRILKFA, oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg, qWtBYHSW9heJXXRTqkaZRg, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, 4BWGVJEqqOnihPxnZbuEzQ, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, e7lJwGbdJsrFziQoXKNJ6w, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA, GMtILOfAHXUMrfMgLPG0gg, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, 2H-ibWQ3ok_LlUeb4SPiLw, J6-9Y2ZpPUjcoN2EH9aYlA, l_szjd-ken3ma6oHDkTYXg, F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA, 2UC3rwRm6swuNFt_GhKOhw, Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w, 6xS41eiB_7MHNjT411-0Cg, ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ, mzG1ixWgZmgi8dcLARGlEw, iyNf5jr-34Bg6nKOGEZXKg, r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ, J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA, 6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA, bZpBAaxC0L9LzrQPUJF7ew, mdJZA5p391bCOZnvAxHV3w, s0qiS71nzMUmqBdM4oPc7Q, kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA, suRGJir2NmSZVnixdIN22Q, e1W6pOaJbovM-jEosgwOCw, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, 9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg, csNALHN2BVA7hVgC9ge-VQ, 0P58MD0FRVI6pTVKUpd7YA, JsKvjx4Qiwvof8RV3luTrw, lAqoz5QTFxp3GDfpq0McRQ, 3_eHstHxLLwqarRifM_6PQ, f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA, wCJbSEmMeZ0mAnJRQEyfCQ, E62SZVU_FsbCYaVnMRs4TA, DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg, Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw, WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg, DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA, Sjb5e5-gKoLXueFDMc2R8Q, bhZ13wN_5lQrKX278AP_aw, lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, KSS6v5fcZNoelu4eEZCFcw, eR-Ay92e9ZAy4J3UfZvb3Q, H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg, ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ, RWSBzkqH2-lsQDH8gVBuEw, XwRyD7_pmXPugYH83fz7yA, 3klCtdbZ6NqaaqXXbcmBRg, Pe6o1SR3T98ONB_SXaHd6Q, jaQtFNFb6iX5kOVvmcu7Pg, tOm1mQutc-UW9H4ME1HToQ, hlpHSNcosmjXQ-gfGXFGRw, v3Zkgv-Re0aUYfmBAPa2ng, GC9ARGIiuJqUJSmVSMzA6w, UgPa7ByY6r7R9nQPC6HAyA, 4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ, Z3pEOLUrG17cntPCFzruPg, Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA, tbulL35tvViEjm_nbUIE2g, adazKj0m2qJWEryQ2wbSCA, V3AKvUyVLlS1Bj1Qr4CN9g, y9Q2mHM8av_2fiqvvers-Q, VRB9nzZnYWB6WETk_QfIEQ, 2Az24juAhTJtmlqr5UWXSQ, L_1ldS4LQxCt7cVN1tfWAQ, yWSSnsbTeusmrASKB6h6Dg, vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA, OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA, 0o7RNtR1IPmS-Z4crt8l5Q, X8JLvSlgfsnhfzb_lOzgbg, es9l0E8GJT4eWyCTSU4C2A, rONxiM8Hafy5kba3ZLoCbA]	Arlene	330	user	{u'funny': 135, u'useful': 580, u'cool': 428}	2013-02

They had a tent where they were offering oysters for free and if I wanted to purchase a lobster salad sandwich i could. Price was reasonable $7.00 for one or 2 for $13.00. I bought one and it was made on a hot dog bun. It was real lobster chilled and tasted very good. I walked inside briefly to get out of the rain and I could smell fish everywhere.

King's Family Restaurant has surprised me with this.  I think it might be in direct dialogue with Eat N' Parks smiling cookie -- funny (funny odd, not funny ha-ha).  We were seated rather quickly by the manager.  Very nice people work here, I was happy to find that even though they had closed a section, the server was willing to stay longer to serve us our dinner.

We chatted with the server a little bit -- she was quite engaging -- and then moved on to order our meal:

Tea
Pepsi
Open-faced Hot Turkey Sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy
Buffalo Chicken strips with mashed potatoes and macaroni n' cheese

Our drinks arrived and our server conversed with us some more about the area.  She would leave every couple of minutes to check on our food and to make certain that her other tables had everything they needed.  Eventually, our entrees arrived -- both piping hot.  I went straight for the macaroni and cheese.  It didn't taste bad, but I swear that it is made by Stouffers.  I didn't feel the need to eat that much knowing that there were other things to eat.  I tried the mashed potatoes and found that they too came from a package; but, again, they didn't taste bad with the brown gravy.  I moved on to the main part of my meal -- the buffalo chicken strips.  At least they were all white meat and the buffalo sauce was more than just mild.  I contented myself with eating them.  

I tried some of the hot turkey sandwich and just left the rest for my friend since it was not fresh cut turkey but instead luncheon meat that had been heated.  I finished off my dinner and was happy in the end.  No, it wasn't the best food in the world, but the service greatly helped the perception and it didn't taste bad."	review	T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 3}	3.11	{u'profile': 6, u'funny': 113, u'cute': 21, u'plain': 439, u'writer': 57, u'list': 9, u'note': 242, u'photos': 22, u'hot': 102, u'more': 40, u'cool': 189}	[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	38	[18kPq7GPye-YQ3LyKyAZPw, rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, K2PDI4_GJLUTwjq0jA2viQ, -NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ, -wOgMGHvNJHQDfqUgX19Qg, 9BApDAgV8POMQ6VffTz3aA, 1Awm0xagllRcAHi4_sNptQ, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 3rtKBEuyR7yr85ufRuYlWQ, qptKNzXrua8-WWwpp846RA, LTWY2Ee-SYu8ItVOebD3CQ, 5yBkoRI9DSKH9aMV3Vadpw, GubdNFoDAsiwE6bWIr97cQ, GUrPmYze-oF6NFDJusiSNw, BaXgT8NGTnWjNUUnOdpRWA, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, ZuQ87LQYWRw3AHj-jEiQ1Q, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, y3zerFCOqhXcmzSXtpKLfg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, d1iH2EPxYMQLbKHN03Y7XQ, z4IHuLSqhPGeiXbf0mogLg, -uslRG-oovrIkvJu2LBW2g, Milv8k4zZsoCaNFZugKtJw, GHbj_ybwEXcN4R8qt7O-cg, GD6xTWmzBozrvdpVCzzLHg, -eveIridBm0gm6hRCNKZeA, qdZOzAWV1fT6QHauVRBB2w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, cMkqpHAb4ZomwMymSQfwBQ, 43f077NnbY_-kupvfczzYg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, 7F8HLz3ErL8b7CNgQqqH9g, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, mfIngaq8vE8XmKETBEl2gw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, TI88k_ezEWaj_XZSiuBNGA, nMXCCLssk_5SBi3wp41ToQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, XmOiFAy168781nzRAYOetg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 4a2SjXc0U4k4MRN2EdcNwg, YFYPlO4RruHZUBVe8quvOw, ZE9-b-6ekeaA9mSIt-ZTyA, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, cD9d9XFoC_bETPzjpnRj9g, R0P932lPm7Be6-YTKwwPOA, Cs6JRqxOADfeqli20F5Yhg, ZPolhetd6Od5_VhXPbFIxw, x_MbMxRc_FVlZrTqclfUyw, BuA2twnOXZOP1yQ6rqi9SQ, CZPATh5KP19TNp9sInf_rA, FDZua5BFEhEOET8e2ztkRw, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, sh1_HCgh_axTFSXoZfjqOA, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 53HVEUP1GLUEwFtespdVdQ, YwVmrb_UVy19HtDs1OwoVg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, LOpKVZIW5-66DocLLQHhhA, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, Sx2OM_pi-NsqNiZk1fMNXw, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, QmykNasFdjyaQ3K8oME3fQ, 4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A, 4YKfzKiJlque5Dd32QD-KQ, MYQ9cWCfqzE5BFEdXUv3fw, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, icf8Tr75xv-QOnI7wZX9Xw, 16TBKdpSyHma7CM5eHy99Q, XJMe4WxPhYNXKZUlZ-29NA]	Sal	808	user	{u'funny': 1209, u'useful': 2147, u'cool': 1251}	2009-01

1. Do the phone numbers match?  Nope, but that's fine since people are always changing their phone numbers anyways.
2. Does the name on account match name on check?  Nope, but mistakes happen at those pesky check companies.
3. Does the account number on the check match the account number on the screen?  Why should it, those computers are always making mistakes.

Now that we have verified that all the information is correct, we can process the payment.  The customer will be so happy that we didn't have to bother them with any silly questions.

779	6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg	2012-10-28	8ndEF_w1kfWZnmdazV7E1g	2	"I really love deep dish pizza. The thick crust that is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The spicy, peppery sauce that can singe your tongue. The mixture of ingredients just sliding down your chin as it bubbles out of your mouth. That being said, I really don't understand why people go to Pizzeria Uno. This chain has done to the deep dish pizza what McDonald's has done to hamburgers, Pizza Hut has done to pan pizza, Dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza, and Taco Bell has done to Tex-Mex; it has made it almost unpalatable. On our menu:

French onion
Chicken bites
Pizza with pepperoni, hamburger, and romano

Looking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature, the food just was not good. Don't get me wrong, this is not the worst pizza I have ever eaten, but this chain is a perfect example of what happens when something becomes so prescribed, overhandled, and overthought that it no longer resembles the original piece of art that tasted so good.

I went to PF Chang's several years ago and was NOT pleased with the food that was presented to me.  

My issue: I thought I was getting Chinese food.  

My resolution: Try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented American food with names of those Chinese dishes I actually like to eat.

So we returned to PF Chang's for lunch to try this American food in this caricature of a Chinese restaurant.  There were very few people in the restaurant.  The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  When our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:

Coca Cola
Iced Tea
Pan fried pork dumplings
Sesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup
Changs chicken with white rice

Our drinks and my soup came out immediately.  Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything.  I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table.  I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  I didn't know what it was and didn't want to know.  Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn't expect to get the stink-eye.

My egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  The server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow.  I saw no reason to continue.  I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  The skins were a bit thick and doughy.  The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off.  I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  We finished our dumplings.

Our lunch entrees arrived.  I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified.  This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken.  Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place.  It is always different.  Many of them are good in different ways.  This food, though, it wasn't good.  Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.  

I just don't understand how anyone can like this place.  Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam's/Costco tastes better."	review	T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ	{u'funny': 3, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 2}	3.11	{u'profile': 6, u'funny': 113, u'cute': 21, u'plain': 439, u'writer': 57, u'list': 9, u'note': 242, u'photos': 22, u'hot': 102, u'more': 40, u'cool': 189}	[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	38	[18kPq7GPye-YQ3LyKyAZPw, rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, K2PDI4_GJLUTwjq0jA2viQ, -NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ, -wOgMGHvNJHQDfqUgX19Qg, 9BApDAgV8POMQ6VffTz3aA, 1Awm0xagllRcAHi4_sNptQ, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 3rtKBEuyR7yr85ufRuYlWQ, qptKNzXrua8-WWwpp846RA, LTWY2Ee-SYu8ItVOebD3CQ, 5yBkoRI9DSKH9aMV3Vadpw, GubdNFoDAsiwE6bWIr97cQ, GUrPmYze-oF6NFDJusiSNw, BaXgT8NGTnWjNUUnOdpRWA, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, ZuQ87LQYWRw3AHj-jEiQ1Q, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, y3zerFCOqhXcmzSXtpKLfg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, d1iH2EPxYMQLbKHN03Y7XQ, z4IHuLSqhPGeiXbf0mogLg, -uslRG-oovrIkvJu2LBW2g, Milv8k4zZsoCaNFZugKtJw, GHbj_ybwEXcN4R8qt7O-cg, GD6xTWmzBozrvdpVCzzLHg, -eveIridBm0gm6hRCNKZeA, qdZOzAWV1fT6QHauVRBB2w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, cMkqpHAb4ZomwMymSQfwBQ, 43f077NnbY_-kupvfczzYg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, 7F8HLz3ErL8b7CNgQqqH9g, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, mfIngaq8vE8XmKETBEl2gw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, TI88k_ezEWaj_XZSiuBNGA, nMXCCLssk_5SBi3wp41ToQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, XmOiFAy168781nzRAYOetg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 4a2SjXc0U4k4MRN2EdcNwg, YFYPlO4RruHZUBVe8quvOw, ZE9-b-6ekeaA9mSIt-ZTyA, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, cD9d9XFoC_bETPzjpnRj9g, R0P932lPm7Be6-YTKwwPOA, Cs6JRqxOADfeqli20F5Yhg, ZPolhetd6Od5_VhXPbFIxw, x_MbMxRc_FVlZrTqclfUyw, BuA2twnOXZOP1yQ6rqi9SQ, CZPATh5KP19TNp9sInf_rA, FDZua5BFEhEOET8e2ztkRw, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, sh1_HCgh_axTFSXoZfjqOA, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 53HVEUP1GLUEwFtespdVdQ, YwVmrb_UVy19HtDs1OwoVg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, LOpKVZIW5-66DocLLQHhhA, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, Sx2OM_pi-NsqNiZk1fMNXw, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, QmykNasFdjyaQ3K8oME3fQ, 4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A, 4YKfzKiJlque5Dd32QD-KQ, MYQ9cWCfqzE5BFEdXUv3fw, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, icf8Tr75xv-QOnI7wZX9Xw, 16TBKdpSyHma7CM5eHy99Q, XJMe4WxPhYNXKZUlZ-29NA]	Sal	808	user	{u'funny': 1209, u'useful': 2147, u'cool': 1251}	2009-01

Stuffed pepper soup and salad bar
Chicken noodle soup
Black angus BBQ burger with macaroni and cheese
Hot turkey sandwich
Pepsi

I love the fact that I can serve my own soup and create my own salad at the bar.  I really love the fact that the salad bar has such good ingredients that are atypical for most places.  I would stay away from the pepper soup, it was not very good.  The hamburger is nothing special, but it tastes good, is not overcooked and has a good barbeque sauce with onions that are actually cooked.

The wait staff and kitchen staff really make a big difference in whether or not an Eat'n Park is worth patronizing.  Eating here, I change my mentality a bit. I always order the seven dollar BBQ burger with the salad bar add on for two dollars. In my mind, I always see myself ordering the seven dollar salad bar with a two dollar hamburger. When the salad bar is kept stocked, it has some really good and fresh items. I love that they have spinach and not just iceburg lettuce. I wish other Eat'n Parks were more like this one.	review	T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.11	{u'profile': 6, u'funny': 113, u'cute': 21, u'plain': 439, u'writer': 57, u'list': 9, u'note': 242, u'photos': 22, u'hot': 102, u'more': 40, u'cool': 189}	[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	38	[18kPq7GPye-YQ3LyKyAZPw, rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, K2PDI4_GJLUTwjq0jA2viQ, -NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ, -wOgMGHvNJHQDfqUgX19Qg, 9BApDAgV8POMQ6VffTz3aA, 1Awm0xagllRcAHi4_sNptQ, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 3rtKBEuyR7yr85ufRuYlWQ, qptKNzXrua8-WWwpp846RA, LTWY2Ee-SYu8ItVOebD3CQ, 5yBkoRI9DSKH9aMV3Vadpw, GubdNFoDAsiwE6bWIr97cQ, GUrPmYze-oF6NFDJusiSNw, BaXgT8NGTnWjNUUnOdpRWA, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, ZuQ87LQYWRw3AHj-jEiQ1Q, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, y3zerFCOqhXcmzSXtpKLfg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, d1iH2EPxYMQLbKHN03Y7XQ, z4IHuLSqhPGeiXbf0mogLg, -uslRG-oovrIkvJu2LBW2g, Milv8k4zZsoCaNFZugKtJw, GHbj_ybwEXcN4R8qt7O-cg, GD6xTWmzBozrvdpVCzzLHg, -eveIridBm0gm6hRCNKZeA, qdZOzAWV1fT6QHauVRBB2w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, cMkqpHAb4ZomwMymSQfwBQ, 43f077NnbY_-kupvfczzYg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, 7F8HLz3ErL8b7CNgQqqH9g, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, mfIngaq8vE8XmKETBEl2gw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, TI88k_ezEWaj_XZSiuBNGA, nMXCCLssk_5SBi3wp41ToQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, XmOiFAy168781nzRAYOetg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 4a2SjXc0U4k4MRN2EdcNwg, YFYPlO4RruHZUBVe8quvOw, ZE9-b-6ekeaA9mSIt-ZTyA, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, cD9d9XFoC_bETPzjpnRj9g, R0P932lPm7Be6-YTKwwPOA, Cs6JRqxOADfeqli20F5Yhg, ZPolhetd6Od5_VhXPbFIxw, x_MbMxRc_FVlZrTqclfUyw, BuA2twnOXZOP1yQ6rqi9SQ, CZPATh5KP19TNp9sInf_rA, FDZua5BFEhEOET8e2ztkRw, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, sh1_HCgh_axTFSXoZfjqOA, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 53HVEUP1GLUEwFtespdVdQ, YwVmrb_UVy19HtDs1OwoVg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, LOpKVZIW5-66DocLLQHhhA, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, Sx2OM_pi-NsqNiZk1fMNXw, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, QmykNasFdjyaQ3K8oME3fQ, 4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A, 4YKfzKiJlque5Dd32QD-KQ, MYQ9cWCfqzE5BFEdXUv3fw, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, icf8Tr75xv-QOnI7wZX9Xw, 16TBKdpSyHma7CM5eHy99Q, XJMe4WxPhYNXKZUlZ-29NA]	Sal	808	user	{u'funny': 1209, u'useful': 2147, u'cool': 1251}	2009-01

Their advertising reach is not very far, but if you get close to them you will see and be inundated by the colorful myriad of amusing bandit signs that are posted.  What caught my eye?  The orange sign that looked like it belonged to a construction company that said, ""Ice Cream in 500 ft.""  Points for originality and tenacity.  

For my first visit, I ordered the following:

Apple Dumpling Sundae
Vanilla Ice Cream with chocolate sauce

The associates were nice and quick and I enjoyed my apply dumpling sundae.  It wasn't too sweet and had really good apple and cinnamon flavor.  I really liked the dichotomy and juxtaposition of the hot of the apples against the cold of the ice cream.

The owners have expanded through several of the first floors of several adjoining buildings on the Mt Oliver Main Street.

As with many of the businesses open in Downtown Mt Oliver, parking is anemic.  Luckily, if you visit at the proper time you won't have to worry about finding a space since there is a large percentage of vacant spots.  All of the associates at this Ace are very friendly and more than willing to help answer any questions you have.  They don't have everything, but they do have a lot.

The cases were less than half full and I found this a tad disconcerting and so asked the lady behind the counter why they were so empty.  She said they they normally sell out of most of their fare very early in the day.  Luckily, they did have a small yellow cake with butter cream frosting.  I ordered one and took it home.

Luckily I had also found additional information to refute those articles.  Why lucky, you ask?  Because this is a great little office nestled off the main drag in Dormont.  Yeah, it's a bit of a drive from Pittsburgh proper, but they are also open later to help with the fact that some of us actually work for a living.

It is a very small waiting room and you really don't want to have to wait due to the different animals that are continually coming through the door -- that is vet common sense -- so make certain you call ahead to get an appointment.  All of the associates were well mannered and fawned over my little Sophie.  All of the paperwork was filled out for us and were were quickly taken back to one of the exam rooms.  Typical exam room with easily cleaned metal table and linoleum floors.

The Vet-Tech was very knowledgeable and seemed truly interested in making certain my puppy was taken care of.  A little preachy near the end, I let it slide knowing why she was saying it -- positive reinforcement for the puppies is the only way to go people, believe it.  The doctor came in soon after and did the full exam on Sophie.  He was quick and methodical, but at no time did I hear my pup whine.  He pointed out things that he saw and gave Sophie her preliminary vaccinations.  

And then all was done.  At no point did he try to up-sell me.  At no point did he or his associates try to give me anything that was not needed.  He was straightforward and plain in his language and he answered all of my questions truthfully.  How do I know?  I already knew the answers to my questions.  I am fairly protective of my Boston Terriers; and as a small breed they have some health idiosyncracies and nuances that many vets don't know about.  He knew the answers.   I was happy.

Giant Eagle offers a lot of things, but they don't offer me everything I am looking for when I go shopping.  Kuhn's, on the other hand, offers all of those little idiosyncrasies and nuances that I look for that I cannot find anywhere else.  The biggest thing for me is the fact that they carry Boar's Head brand luncheon meats.  I really don't know how anyone eats any other brand of luncheon meat since they all just taste so stale in comparison.  

I can tell that a higher number of Italian-American folk patronize this store as well.  Why? The pasta selection is awesome.  I despise the typical noodles carried everywhere else; but here I can find the noodles that I have grown to love.  

Getting beyond the reasons above, I do enjoy the store as a whole and the fact that I can find what I am looking for.  I will definitely be returning; I just have to make certain to be careful of the parking situation since this particular store's parking lot layout is prone to jamming.  In this case, it is better to park near PNC and walk."	review	T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.11	{u'profile': 6, u'funny': 113, u'cute': 21, u'plain': 439, u'writer': 57, u'list': 9, u'note': 242, u'photos': 22, u'hot': 102, u'more': 40, u'cool': 189}	[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	38	[18kPq7GPye-YQ3LyKyAZPw, rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, K2PDI4_GJLUTwjq0jA2viQ, -NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ, -wOgMGHvNJHQDfqUgX19Qg, 9BApDAgV8POMQ6VffTz3aA, 1Awm0xagllRcAHi4_sNptQ, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 3rtKBEuyR7yr85ufRuYlWQ, qptKNzXrua8-WWwpp846RA, LTWY2Ee-SYu8ItVOebD3CQ, 5yBkoRI9DSKH9aMV3Vadpw, GubdNFoDAsiwE6bWIr97cQ, GUrPmYze-oF6NFDJusiSNw, BaXgT8NGTnWjNUUnOdpRWA, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, ZuQ87LQYWRw3AHj-jEiQ1Q, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, y3zerFCOqhXcmzSXtpKLfg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, d1iH2EPxYMQLbKHN03Y7XQ, z4IHuLSqhPGeiXbf0mogLg, -uslRG-oovrIkvJu2LBW2g, Milv8k4zZsoCaNFZugKtJw, GHbj_ybwEXcN4R8qt7O-cg, GD6xTWmzBozrvdpVCzzLHg, -eveIridBm0gm6hRCNKZeA, qdZOzAWV1fT6QHauVRBB2w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, cMkqpHAb4ZomwMymSQfwBQ, 43f077NnbY_-kupvfczzYg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, 7F8HLz3ErL8b7CNgQqqH9g, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, mfIngaq8vE8XmKETBEl2gw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, TI88k_ezEWaj_XZSiuBNGA, nMXCCLssk_5SBi3wp41ToQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, XmOiFAy168781nzRAYOetg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 4a2SjXc0U4k4MRN2EdcNwg, YFYPlO4RruHZUBVe8quvOw, ZE9-b-6ekeaA9mSIt-ZTyA, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, cD9d9XFoC_bETPzjpnRj9g, R0P932lPm7Be6-YTKwwPOA, Cs6JRqxOADfeqli20F5Yhg, ZPolhetd6Od5_VhXPbFIxw, x_MbMxRc_FVlZrTqclfUyw, BuA2twnOXZOP1yQ6rqi9SQ, CZPATh5KP19TNp9sInf_rA, FDZua5BFEhEOET8e2ztkRw, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, sh1_HCgh_axTFSXoZfjqOA, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 53HVEUP1GLUEwFtespdVdQ, YwVmrb_UVy19HtDs1OwoVg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, LOpKVZIW5-66DocLLQHhhA, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, Sx2OM_pi-NsqNiZk1fMNXw, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, QmykNasFdjyaQ3K8oME3fQ, 4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A, 4YKfzKiJlque5Dd32QD-KQ, MYQ9cWCfqzE5BFEdXUv3fw, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, icf8Tr75xv-QOnI7wZX9Xw, 16TBKdpSyHma7CM5eHy99Q, XJMe4WxPhYNXKZUlZ-29NA]	Sal	808	user	{u'funny': 1209, u'useful': 2147, u'cool': 1251}	2009-01

I was bit apprehensive about this experience since it is so difficult to go to a new place and the barber/stylist not know what you want.  Kimmie was awesome though, she KNOWS how to cut a guys hair.  I was surprised to find that she was using Barber Clippers rather than the Stylist Clippers with guards that are used in Florida.  I could have gotten a Five-Aught had I wanted to go that short -- TOO COLD!  

Kimmie worked wonders and moved rather quickly.  I was very happy with the hair cut she gave me for two very big reasons:
1. She could do a true military high taper without having to be coached.
2. She actually listened to what I wanted and didn't impose her own thoughts on the situation.

YES!  HOME RUN!  I will return!  And no, I did not have an appointment.  I just showed up 30 minutes before they closed.

You go in, you order at the counter, you pay, you get your food and then take it to your seat just like every other fast food joint.  But here, you have fresh roasted chicken -- MMM.  

Today was an off day, though, and they had sold out of the chicken.  The associates said they had an untimely barrage of customers and that it would be ten more minutes before the next batch of chicken was ready,  not wanting to wait I opted to try one of their newer sandwiches and ordered:

Brisket and Swiss dip (au jus)
Mac n cheese
Mashed Potatoes and brown gravy

I love Boston Market's Mac n' cheese.  The noodles are spiral and always al dente -- today was no different. The mashed potatoes and gravy -- while obviously not homemade -- are always good with a little pepper.  I must say, though, that my chicken stand-in was also very good.  Not up to the fresh chicken standards; but good none-the-less.  The meat was moist and the au jus was flavorful.  I wish the bread was not as dry, but I had au jus so there was balance.

I made it a point to tell myself that I should stop in and get myself something to eat. I love Tex-Mex food and am always looking for new places to patronize. 

I stopped in during lunch and ordered a steak burrito with guacamole to go. When I received my order I immediately opened it to take a bite. I was immediately underwhelmed. I saw that they had some Tapatio and added it to the full course of my burrito and took my leave of the little corner store.

The best part of the burrito was the Tapatio that I added after the fact. The issues with it were myriad. My biggest issue was the utter lack of any taste. That's right, my burrito had no flavor. How do you make a steak burrito with guacamole and pinto beans without any flavor what-so-ever in any of the components? Not far behind that question was the fact that my steak burrito had almost no steak. It was all beans and guacamole. Don't get me wrong, I like beans and guacamole when they are properly made, but I ordered a STEAK burrito and not a bean burrito seasoned with a few pieces of meat.

I might try this place again to give it another chance, but I would stay away from the steak burrito and would most likely eat vegan that day just to see if the lack of flavor was situational."	review	T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.11	{u'profile': 6, u'funny': 113, u'cute': 21, u'plain': 439, u'writer': 57, u'list': 9, u'note': 242, u'photos': 22, u'hot': 102, u'more': 40, u'cool': 189}	[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	38	[18kPq7GPye-YQ3LyKyAZPw, rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, K2PDI4_GJLUTwjq0jA2viQ, -NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ, -wOgMGHvNJHQDfqUgX19Qg, 9BApDAgV8POMQ6VffTz3aA, 1Awm0xagllRcAHi4_sNptQ, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 3rtKBEuyR7yr85ufRuYlWQ, qptKNzXrua8-WWwpp846RA, LTWY2Ee-SYu8ItVOebD3CQ, 5yBkoRI9DSKH9aMV3Vadpw, GubdNFoDAsiwE6bWIr97cQ, GUrPmYze-oF6NFDJusiSNw, BaXgT8NGTnWjNUUnOdpRWA, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, ZuQ87LQYWRw3AHj-jEiQ1Q, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, y3zerFCOqhXcmzSXtpKLfg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, d1iH2EPxYMQLbKHN03Y7XQ, z4IHuLSqhPGeiXbf0mogLg, -uslRG-oovrIkvJu2LBW2g, Milv8k4zZsoCaNFZugKtJw, GHbj_ybwEXcN4R8qt7O-cg, GD6xTWmzBozrvdpVCzzLHg, -eveIridBm0gm6hRCNKZeA, qdZOzAWV1fT6QHauVRBB2w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, cMkqpHAb4ZomwMymSQfwBQ, 43f077NnbY_-kupvfczzYg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, 7F8HLz3ErL8b7CNgQqqH9g, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, mfIngaq8vE8XmKETBEl2gw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, TI88k_ezEWaj_XZSiuBNGA, nMXCCLssk_5SBi3wp41ToQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, XmOiFAy168781nzRAYOetg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 4a2SjXc0U4k4MRN2EdcNwg, YFYPlO4RruHZUBVe8quvOw, ZE9-b-6ekeaA9mSIt-ZTyA, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, cD9d9XFoC_bETPzjpnRj9g, R0P932lPm7Be6-YTKwwPOA, Cs6JRqxOADfeqli20F5Yhg, ZPolhetd6Od5_VhXPbFIxw, x_MbMxRc_FVlZrTqclfUyw, BuA2twnOXZOP1yQ6rqi9SQ, CZPATh5KP19TNp9sInf_rA, FDZua5BFEhEOET8e2ztkRw, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, sh1_HCgh_axTFSXoZfjqOA, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 53HVEUP1GLUEwFtespdVdQ, YwVmrb_UVy19HtDs1OwoVg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, LOpKVZIW5-66DocLLQHhhA, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, Sx2OM_pi-NsqNiZk1fMNXw, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, QmykNasFdjyaQ3K8oME3fQ, 4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A, 4YKfzKiJlque5Dd32QD-KQ, MYQ9cWCfqzE5BFEdXUv3fw, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, icf8Tr75xv-QOnI7wZX9Xw, 16TBKdpSyHma7CM5eHy99Q, XJMe4WxPhYNXKZUlZ-29NA]	Sal	808	user	{u'funny': 1209, u'useful': 2147, u'cool': 1251}	2009-01
797	XzaJf6WzpU7RsXTXzx72Xg	2011-11-06	drFgUzwrbLazMkWARsoukA	2	"I came to Cafe Sam with high hopes.  Ritter's Diner is directly across the street and I eat there all the time.  In my mind a place can only  get better.  As our party of three walks in we are promptly seated by the manager.  Looking over the menu, we all decide on what we want and order:

French Onion
Buffalo Chicken Medallions 
Fish Tacos with salsa and guacamole
Cheeseburger (medium) with apple sauce and potato salad
Side of Fries
Water and Iced Tea with Lemon

Bread with butter, olive oil infused with pumpkin, and our drinks soon arrive.  ALERT: The tea is flavored.  I really do dislike flavored teas, but I put extra lemon in mine to cover the foul taste and continued on.  The bread was slightly aged as the crust was somewhat hard.  The olive oil was fairly tasteless, but fresh.  I would never use a light olive oil for tasting purposes like Cafe Sam did.  While it was an interesting thought to add pumpkin seeds -- this is the current theme -- they didn't add that much to the oil.  At least the butter was soft rather than frozen.

As we planned work for the next next day, our Buffalo Chicken Medallions arrived.  They need to remove the ""s"" from Medallions as there was only piece.  In fact, they need to remove ""medallion"" and ""buffalo"" from the name and call it something else.  It was just a piece of chicken breast dredged in Cajun seasoning with a few stray strands of cheese melted on it.  Don't get me wrong, it didn't taste bad; but a better name would have been ""Cajun Chicken Breast"" rather than what they call it now.  As I ate the chicken, the French Onion Soup arrived.  This crock of soup looked exceptionally good.  The cheese on top was browned to the proper point.  I took the spoon and cut in with a voraciousness as I could taste it already.  When I put the first bite in my mouth though, the flavor was flat.  I took another bite and it was the same thing.  This wasn't French Onion soup with layers of flavor, but an onion broth that had some cheap, melted cheese on top.  It didn't taste bad, but anyone could make this soup.

I ate half the soup and passed it on to my friend to finish along with the rest of the chicken breast.  I didn't want to eat too much and then not be able to eat the main course.  

As my friend finished the soup our entrees arrived.  The cheeseburger was served on a piece of a larger sesame baguette and came well done rather than the requested medium.  I didn't try it due to the fact it was overcooked and had sesame seeds.  I did try the apple sauce and the potato salad, though.  The potato salad was just not tasty.  One bite and I didn't want to take another.  The apple sauce, on the other hand, was quite tasty -- I wouldn't call it apple sauce, though.  It was more along the line of fried apples -- some damn tasty fried apples.

As I wasn't having any of the cheeseburger, I ate all of the fish tacos.  The tacos arrived presented on a sprinkling of iceberg lettuce.  I would think that they should make it a bed of lettuce or just omit it all together.  I am for the latter over the former as I don't eat iceberg lettuce -- no nutrients, just water.  While the fish didn't have bad flavor, it was a tad overcooked.  When I started to eat the tacos, this wasn't a big deal.  As the fish cooled off, though, they started to get too hard for their own good.  The fish tacos need to be cooked less, especially with the fact that they are using white, flaky fish, which is easily overcooked.  At least the guacamole was fresh and tasted good.

All in all, this was a lackluster event.  If not for the fried apples, guacamole, and great service this would have been a one-star.  I don't know that I would ever willingly return since I was in sticker shock when our server brought our check.  The price was not commensurate with the quality of the food.  People complain about the quality of the food at Ritter's diner, but the food is actually commensurate to the price that you pay.  When I pay over $20 a person to eat, I expect better than diner fare."	review	T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 1}	3.11	{u'profile': 6, u'funny': 113, u'cute': 21, u'plain': 439, u'writer': 57, u'list': 9, u'note': 242, u'photos': 22, u'hot': 102, u'more': 40, u'cool': 189}	[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	38	[18kPq7GPye-YQ3LyKyAZPw, rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, K2PDI4_GJLUTwjq0jA2viQ, -NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ, -wOgMGHvNJHQDfqUgX19Qg, 9BApDAgV8POMQ6VffTz3aA, 1Awm0xagllRcAHi4_sNptQ, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 3rtKBEuyR7yr85ufRuYlWQ, qptKNzXrua8-WWwpp846RA, LTWY2Ee-SYu8ItVOebD3CQ, 5yBkoRI9DSKH9aMV3Vadpw, GubdNFoDAsiwE6bWIr97cQ, GUrPmYze-oF6NFDJusiSNw, BaXgT8NGTnWjNUUnOdpRWA, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, ZuQ87LQYWRw3AHj-jEiQ1Q, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, y3zerFCOqhXcmzSXtpKLfg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, d1iH2EPxYMQLbKHN03Y7XQ, z4IHuLSqhPGeiXbf0mogLg, -uslRG-oovrIkvJu2LBW2g, Milv8k4zZsoCaNFZugKtJw, GHbj_ybwEXcN4R8qt7O-cg, GD6xTWmzBozrvdpVCzzLHg, -eveIridBm0gm6hRCNKZeA, qdZOzAWV1fT6QHauVRBB2w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, cMkqpHAb4ZomwMymSQfwBQ, 43f077NnbY_-kupvfczzYg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, 7F8HLz3ErL8b7CNgQqqH9g, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, mfIngaq8vE8XmKETBEl2gw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, TI88k_ezEWaj_XZSiuBNGA, nMXCCLssk_5SBi3wp41ToQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, XmOiFAy168781nzRAYOetg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 4a2SjXc0U4k4MRN2EdcNwg, YFYPlO4RruHZUBVe8quvOw, ZE9-b-6ekeaA9mSIt-ZTyA, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, cD9d9XFoC_bETPzjpnRj9g, R0P932lPm7Be6-YTKwwPOA, Cs6JRqxOADfeqli20F5Yhg, ZPolhetd6Od5_VhXPbFIxw, x_MbMxRc_FVlZrTqclfUyw, BuA2twnOXZOP1yQ6rqi9SQ, CZPATh5KP19TNp9sInf_rA, FDZua5BFEhEOET8e2ztkRw, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, sh1_HCgh_axTFSXoZfjqOA, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 53HVEUP1GLUEwFtespdVdQ, YwVmrb_UVy19HtDs1OwoVg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, LOpKVZIW5-66DocLLQHhhA, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, Sx2OM_pi-NsqNiZk1fMNXw, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, QmykNasFdjyaQ3K8oME3fQ, 4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A, 4YKfzKiJlque5Dd32QD-KQ, MYQ9cWCfqzE5BFEdXUv3fw, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, icf8Tr75xv-QOnI7wZX9Xw, 16TBKdpSyHma7CM5eHy99Q, XJMe4WxPhYNXKZUlZ-29NA]	Sal	808	user	{u'funny': 1209, u'useful': 2147, u'cool': 1251}	2009-01

All that is truly required is that you find one item on the menu that you really enjoy. For me, that one item is the Grilled Chicken Breast Dinner. I almost always get this item with the veggie of the day, sliced tomatoes or sliced cucumbers. It always tastes good and it never breaks the bank. Sometimes I might get breakfast, but usually it is the grilled chicken breast.

Everyone should try Ritter's at least once.  They only accept cash, but they do have an ATM present at the entry.

The lack of pretentiousness and extraneous decor in the building are mirrored in the food that you get here.  I would recommend staying away during popular hours due to the fact that the parking is somewhat difficult -- the scant parking is on the side of the building and on the side of the road going up the steep hill.  

It really doesn't matter if you will be dining in or carrying out, you need to walk to the counter first to place your order.  If you have more than one person in your group, all the better since they can be on the look-out for a coveted table.  Once you order, pay for it.  On my first time here, I sat down and waited to be served -- they won't come.  I then ordered at the counter and was given the option of paying before or after the meal and I chose after -- the people making the food will assume you haven't arrived and will go slow in the preparation, PAY!

With the niceties out of the way, you can focus on finding a table or just sit back and relax if someone in your crew already found one.  I have been here twice already and these people just don't stop.  It is a well-greased assembly line that only lets you down if you don't follow the proper path (look at the above paragraph).  Both times I contented myself to watch the large numbers of people that enter through this pizza parlours doors while we waited on our order:

First Trip only:
Garlic bread
Hot wings

Both Trips:
Meatballs (x2) and red sauce
Pepperoni Pizza with Extra Cheese (12"" - 8 cut)

The meatballs, wings, and bread came out rather quickly.  The garlic bread was nothing special, just a loaf brushed with a garlic oil and warmed.  Very simple, but somewhat weak in the garlic department.  The buffalo wings were good.  They were not hot/piquant; but they actually had good flavor and that is really what counts.  They were slightly more acidic than many of the wings that I have had in the area and that went well with a little bit of blue cheese.  The meatballs were about the size of a racketball.  Very little to no seasoning in both the sauce and the meatballs.  I was quite surprised to find that I enjoyed them.  The small number of ingredients that go into making this simple sauce and meatball had to be in proper proportion each time to get that wonderful flavor -- so far they are batting 2/2.  

Our pizza arrived steaming hot and smelling wonderful.  I could tell from the small bits of brown that were beginning in the cheese that the pizza had been cooked fully and to the proper temperature.  There is nothing worse than a pizza that is pulled too soon.  I ate my first piece and was amazed at the flavors.  The pizza, overall, had a sweet undertone.  As I started on my second piece, I began to take more note of the flavors.  The crust had a slightly sweet flavor, was a tad doughy/soft, but was super thin and had a very good flavor.  The sauce was also sweet; it tasted like the sauce that came with the meatballs.  Tasting the pepperoni, again there was this sweet undertone to it.  

I must say, I am not usually a fan of sweet foods, but this wasn't unnaturally sweet and it was tasting good.  What amazed me the most was the near-perfect execution of the pizza with so few ingredients and none of the usual and stereotypical Italian seasonings.  Yeah, I enjoyed this pizza.  It is definitely the best I have had in Pittsburgh.  I will be returning for my pizza fix again and again and again...  

They only accept cash, if you have none there is a convenient ATM near the singles/kiddie bar.  They are open until 3am on the weekends, so if you get a late night hankering for pizza you are in luck.  Just be advised you will have to then battle the post-bar crowd.

NOTE:  If you must have the Italian seasoning, you won't like this pizza.  Also, be careful of ordering too many toppings or extra cheese as the crust is so thin and has a hard time holding it up -- not an issue if you eat with a fork."	review	T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 5, u'cool': 2}	3.11	{u'profile': 6, u'funny': 113, u'cute': 21, u'plain': 439, u'writer': 57, u'list': 9, u'note': 242, u'photos': 22, u'hot': 102, u'more': 40, u'cool': 189}	[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	38	[18kPq7GPye-YQ3LyKyAZPw, rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, K2PDI4_GJLUTwjq0jA2viQ, -NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ, -wOgMGHvNJHQDfqUgX19Qg, 9BApDAgV8POMQ6VffTz3aA, 1Awm0xagllRcAHi4_sNptQ, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 3rtKBEuyR7yr85ufRuYlWQ, qptKNzXrua8-WWwpp846RA, LTWY2Ee-SYu8ItVOebD3CQ, 5yBkoRI9DSKH9aMV3Vadpw, GubdNFoDAsiwE6bWIr97cQ, GUrPmYze-oF6NFDJusiSNw, BaXgT8NGTnWjNUUnOdpRWA, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, ZuQ87LQYWRw3AHj-jEiQ1Q, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, y3zerFCOqhXcmzSXtpKLfg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, d1iH2EPxYMQLbKHN03Y7XQ, z4IHuLSqhPGeiXbf0mogLg, -uslRG-oovrIkvJu2LBW2g, Milv8k4zZsoCaNFZugKtJw, GHbj_ybwEXcN4R8qt7O-cg, GD6xTWmzBozrvdpVCzzLHg, -eveIridBm0gm6hRCNKZeA, qdZOzAWV1fT6QHauVRBB2w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, cMkqpHAb4ZomwMymSQfwBQ, 43f077NnbY_-kupvfczzYg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, 7F8HLz3ErL8b7CNgQqqH9g, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, mfIngaq8vE8XmKETBEl2gw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, TI88k_ezEWaj_XZSiuBNGA, nMXCCLssk_5SBi3wp41ToQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, XmOiFAy168781nzRAYOetg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 4a2SjXc0U4k4MRN2EdcNwg, YFYPlO4RruHZUBVe8quvOw, ZE9-b-6ekeaA9mSIt-ZTyA, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, cD9d9XFoC_bETPzjpnRj9g, R0P932lPm7Be6-YTKwwPOA, Cs6JRqxOADfeqli20F5Yhg, ZPolhetd6Od5_VhXPbFIxw, x_MbMxRc_FVlZrTqclfUyw, BuA2twnOXZOP1yQ6rqi9SQ, CZPATh5KP19TNp9sInf_rA, FDZua5BFEhEOET8e2ztkRw, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, sh1_HCgh_axTFSXoZfjqOA, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 53HVEUP1GLUEwFtespdVdQ, YwVmrb_UVy19HtDs1OwoVg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, LOpKVZIW5-66DocLLQHhhA, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, Sx2OM_pi-NsqNiZk1fMNXw, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, QmykNasFdjyaQ3K8oME3fQ, 4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A, 4YKfzKiJlque5Dd32QD-KQ, MYQ9cWCfqzE5BFEdXUv3fw, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, icf8Tr75xv-QOnI7wZX9Xw, 16TBKdpSyHma7CM5eHy99Q, XJMe4WxPhYNXKZUlZ-29NA]	Sal	808	user	{u'funny': 1209, u'useful': 2147, u'cool': 1251}	2009-01

Passing by it several times (parking is at a premium) we finally found a spot the third time around.  Tells you how much we wanted some fresh bakery fare.  As we entered the door, ""CLICK,"" and the door was locked.  Talk about good luck.  The ladies told us to take our time.  Somehow we had managed to get through the door about 45 minutes after closing.  Oh, what luck on our part.  

The place smelled wonderful and the cakes, cookies, eclairs, pies, etc. all looked amazing.  First thing my friend asked about was a particular type of cake that he had been craving for a while.  Of course they had the Yellow Cake with buttercream frosting that he wanted.  She boxed it up and then we asked her to give us 12 assorted cookies, bakers choice but no nuts.

Feeling happy about our current collection, I happened upon what appeared to be an apple purse.  It was in fact an apple dumpling (a whole apple inside rather than diced apple) and it rounded our order for the night.

We couldn't wait, we started munching on the cookies.  They were fresh and good.  I particularly like the oatmeal raisin that she put in and the mint chocolate chip tree was the most unusual one.  After my fourth cookie, the box was removed from my hands and I was told that I couldn't have any more until after dinner.  That is not made-up.

After having eaten some of the cake and the apple dumpling, I must say that I will return.  The dumpling could use a little more cinnamon and I could taste the extra acid that was used (lemon juice?) but I am fairly fond of it.  Yes, I will return."	review	T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ	{u'funny': 5, u'useful': 4, u'cool': 5}	3.11	{u'profile': 6, u'funny': 113, u'cute': 21, u'plain': 439, u'writer': 57, u'list': 9, u'note': 242, u'photos': 22, u'hot': 102, u'more': 40, u'cool': 189}	[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	38	[18kPq7GPye-YQ3LyKyAZPw, rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, K2PDI4_GJLUTwjq0jA2viQ, -NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ, -wOgMGHvNJHQDfqUgX19Qg, 9BApDAgV8POMQ6VffTz3aA, 1Awm0xagllRcAHi4_sNptQ, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 3rtKBEuyR7yr85ufRuYlWQ, qptKNzXrua8-WWwpp846RA, LTWY2Ee-SYu8ItVOebD3CQ, 5yBkoRI9DSKH9aMV3Vadpw, GubdNFoDAsiwE6bWIr97cQ, GUrPmYze-oF6NFDJusiSNw, BaXgT8NGTnWjNUUnOdpRWA, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, ZuQ87LQYWRw3AHj-jEiQ1Q, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, y3zerFCOqhXcmzSXtpKLfg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, d1iH2EPxYMQLbKHN03Y7XQ, z4IHuLSqhPGeiXbf0mogLg, -uslRG-oovrIkvJu2LBW2g, Milv8k4zZsoCaNFZugKtJw, GHbj_ybwEXcN4R8qt7O-cg, GD6xTWmzBozrvdpVCzzLHg, -eveIridBm0gm6hRCNKZeA, qdZOzAWV1fT6QHauVRBB2w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, cMkqpHAb4ZomwMymSQfwBQ, 43f077NnbY_-kupvfczzYg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, 7F8HLz3ErL8b7CNgQqqH9g, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, mfIngaq8vE8XmKETBEl2gw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, TI88k_ezEWaj_XZSiuBNGA, nMXCCLssk_5SBi3wp41ToQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, XmOiFAy168781nzRAYOetg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 4a2SjXc0U4k4MRN2EdcNwg, YFYPlO4RruHZUBVe8quvOw, ZE9-b-6ekeaA9mSIt-ZTyA, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, cD9d9XFoC_bETPzjpnRj9g, R0P932lPm7Be6-YTKwwPOA, Cs6JRqxOADfeqli20F5Yhg, ZPolhetd6Od5_VhXPbFIxw, x_MbMxRc_FVlZrTqclfUyw, BuA2twnOXZOP1yQ6rqi9SQ, CZPATh5KP19TNp9sInf_rA, FDZua5BFEhEOET8e2ztkRw, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, sh1_HCgh_axTFSXoZfjqOA, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 53HVEUP1GLUEwFtespdVdQ, YwVmrb_UVy19HtDs1OwoVg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, LOpKVZIW5-66DocLLQHhhA, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, Sx2OM_pi-NsqNiZk1fMNXw, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, QmykNasFdjyaQ3K8oME3fQ, 4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A, 4YKfzKiJlque5Dd32QD-KQ, MYQ9cWCfqzE5BFEdXUv3fw, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, icf8Tr75xv-QOnI7wZX9Xw, 16TBKdpSyHma7CM5eHy99Q, XJMe4WxPhYNXKZUlZ-29NA]	Sal	808	user	{u'funny': 1209, u'useful': 2147, u'cool': 1251}	2009-01

Due to how late it was on Saturday, the only thing open was the movie theater.  After having the Starbucks people laugh at me, I decided I would look around a little bit. 

There are a lot of higher end stores and shops for those people that are around, but I enjoyed the vistas one gets from having a multi-tiered building that actually engages the mountainside into which it is built.

I really like the Market District versions of Giant Eagle since they carry SO MUCH more of what I like to purchase.

I love the fact that I can get all of my Goya products here as well as a wide variety of gluten-free items.

This little diner is a quirky, neighborhood eatery where a lot of regulars and locals can be seen on a daily basis. Almost everything on the menu is made fresh. 

Our usual order:
Chicken Noodle Soup
Ham and Cheese Omelet and Home Fries with Onions well-done and Italian Toast
Three Eggs Poached Medium, Extra-soft Bacon, Italian Toast and home fries with onion well done

Sometimes we might add in some wings or some pancakes, but it is rare. The wings take quite a while to cook as they are made to order, but their flavor is rather good. All of the breakfast items are stable, are cooked properly every time, and won't kill your pocketbook. 

My only issue with Barb's is that they don't have butter.

I am a huge fan of bangers and mash and so I couldn't wait to try out everything.  The hosts and servers were great and we were promptly seated.  There is a fairly new, clean interior that is split into a bar section and a dining section with some overlap depending on the group and what they are looking for.  I liked the atmosphere.  After perusing the menu, we settled on the following items:

Gaelic four onion soup
Scotch eggs
Open faced roast beef
Bangers and mash
Draft Rootbeer

The Onion soup is NOT a French onion soup.  It is its own entity with its own ingredients and flavors.  Over time, I have learned to just expect a French onion knock-off when it comes to onion soup.  Kudos to Piper's Pub for doing something different.  There is a large crouton with stilton baked into it.  It tastes quite good with the soup.  My only issue with the soup was the onions -- they were not completely tender.  Is it possible to have the onions in the soup cooked a little longer to completely soften them up? I know this is a personal preference and I would probably order the soup again but I would only consume the broth.  

While eating the soup I ordered a draft rootbeer.  Completely excited about having a good, fresh rootbeer.  I was somewhat flustered to find that it was somewhat weak when I tasted it, though.  The flavor was there, but why was it so watered down?

My first time having Scotch eggs.  It is a hardboiled egg encased in ground sausage, fried, and then served with hot sauce.  The flavors were interesting, but it was difficult to get past the flavor of the exterior.  It tasted overcooked and bordered on burnt.  Is this normal?  As we finished this novel, new appetizer our entrees arrived.

Both entrees looked awesome.  Spectacular presentation for both entrees.  I went directly for the sausage and my palate left me perplexed.  The banger they use has a heavy-handed spice.  I tried the sausage with the half-mashed potatos and the gravy in differing quantities and couldn't get past the flavor endemic in the sausage.  I had to stop eating it.  I was able to split the open-faced roast beef with my friend.  The gravy was good.  The half-mashed potatos were good.  The roast beef was good.  WHY did the bangers have such a high dosage of this anathemic spice?  

Ho Hum.  Will I return?  Yes, I will give Piper's another try; I will just make certain to steer clear of the bangers."	review	T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 4, u'cool': 2}	3.11	{u'profile': 6, u'funny': 113, u'cute': 21, u'plain': 439, u'writer': 57, u'list': 9, u'note': 242, u'photos': 22, u'hot': 102, u'more': 40, u'cool': 189}	[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	38	[18kPq7GPye-YQ3LyKyAZPw, rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, K2PDI4_GJLUTwjq0jA2viQ, -NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ, -wOgMGHvNJHQDfqUgX19Qg, 9BApDAgV8POMQ6VffTz3aA, 1Awm0xagllRcAHi4_sNptQ, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 3rtKBEuyR7yr85ufRuYlWQ, qptKNzXrua8-WWwpp846RA, LTWY2Ee-SYu8ItVOebD3CQ, 5yBkoRI9DSKH9aMV3Vadpw, GubdNFoDAsiwE6bWIr97cQ, GUrPmYze-oF6NFDJusiSNw, BaXgT8NGTnWjNUUnOdpRWA, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, ZuQ87LQYWRw3AHj-jEiQ1Q, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, y3zerFCOqhXcmzSXtpKLfg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, d1iH2EPxYMQLbKHN03Y7XQ, z4IHuLSqhPGeiXbf0mogLg, -uslRG-oovrIkvJu2LBW2g, Milv8k4zZsoCaNFZugKtJw, GHbj_ybwEXcN4R8qt7O-cg, GD6xTWmzBozrvdpVCzzLHg, -eveIridBm0gm6hRCNKZeA, qdZOzAWV1fT6QHauVRBB2w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, cMkqpHAb4ZomwMymSQfwBQ, 43f077NnbY_-kupvfczzYg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, 7F8HLz3ErL8b7CNgQqqH9g, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, mfIngaq8vE8XmKETBEl2gw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, TI88k_ezEWaj_XZSiuBNGA, nMXCCLssk_5SBi3wp41ToQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, XmOiFAy168781nzRAYOetg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 4a2SjXc0U4k4MRN2EdcNwg, YFYPlO4RruHZUBVe8quvOw, ZE9-b-6ekeaA9mSIt-ZTyA, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, cD9d9XFoC_bETPzjpnRj9g, R0P932lPm7Be6-YTKwwPOA, Cs6JRqxOADfeqli20F5Yhg, ZPolhetd6Od5_VhXPbFIxw, x_MbMxRc_FVlZrTqclfUyw, BuA2twnOXZOP1yQ6rqi9SQ, CZPATh5KP19TNp9sInf_rA, FDZua5BFEhEOET8e2ztkRw, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, sh1_HCgh_axTFSXoZfjqOA, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 53HVEUP1GLUEwFtespdVdQ, YwVmrb_UVy19HtDs1OwoVg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, LOpKVZIW5-66DocLLQHhhA, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, Sx2OM_pi-NsqNiZk1fMNXw, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, QmykNasFdjyaQ3K8oME3fQ, 4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A, 4YKfzKiJlque5Dd32QD-KQ, MYQ9cWCfqzE5BFEdXUv3fw, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, icf8Tr75xv-QOnI7wZX9Xw, 16TBKdpSyHma7CM5eHy99Q, XJMe4WxPhYNXKZUlZ-29NA]	Sal	808	user	{u'funny': 1209, u'useful': 2147, u'cool': 1251}	2009-01

We sat at the drink bar and looked through the menu to find items that we might want.  It doesn't take me long to find what I want in an Asian restaurant:

Gyoza
Spider roll
Spicy tuna roll
Spicy chicken pieces
Hibachi fried rice
Marinated beef tips

Everything arrived in increments, which was great since it was so much food.  Our drinks were always full and the service was spectacular.  Where did Nakama go wrong?  All of the food tasted like a shadow of what it could have been. The flavors were not vibrant, which really was sad since I could tell that the ingredients were fresh.  My sushi didn't smell and it didn't have a fishy taste; it just had very little taste altogether.  

Nothing was spicy -- piquant -- that was supposed to be spicy.  The spicy chicken pieces are more sweet than anything else and the beef and rice was just as flavorless.  I wish that there was more flavor to everything that I ate; especially considering the price tag."	review	T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 4, u'cool': 2}	3.11	{u'profile': 6, u'funny': 113, u'cute': 21, u'plain': 439, u'writer': 57, u'list': 9, u'note': 242, u'photos': 22, u'hot': 102, u'more': 40, u'cool': 189}	[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	38	[18kPq7GPye-YQ3LyKyAZPw, rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, K2PDI4_GJLUTwjq0jA2viQ, -NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ, -wOgMGHvNJHQDfqUgX19Qg, 9BApDAgV8POMQ6VffTz3aA, 1Awm0xagllRcAHi4_sNptQ, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 3rtKBEuyR7yr85ufRuYlWQ, qptKNzXrua8-WWwpp846RA, LTWY2Ee-SYu8ItVOebD3CQ, 5yBkoRI9DSKH9aMV3Vadpw, GubdNFoDAsiwE6bWIr97cQ, GUrPmYze-oF6NFDJusiSNw, BaXgT8NGTnWjNUUnOdpRWA, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, ZuQ87LQYWRw3AHj-jEiQ1Q, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, y3zerFCOqhXcmzSXtpKLfg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, d1iH2EPxYMQLbKHN03Y7XQ, z4IHuLSqhPGeiXbf0mogLg, -uslRG-oovrIkvJu2LBW2g, Milv8k4zZsoCaNFZugKtJw, GHbj_ybwEXcN4R8qt7O-cg, GD6xTWmzBozrvdpVCzzLHg, -eveIridBm0gm6hRCNKZeA, qdZOzAWV1fT6QHauVRBB2w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, cMkqpHAb4ZomwMymSQfwBQ, 43f077NnbY_-kupvfczzYg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, 7F8HLz3ErL8b7CNgQqqH9g, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, mfIngaq8vE8XmKETBEl2gw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, TI88k_ezEWaj_XZSiuBNGA, nMXCCLssk_5SBi3wp41ToQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, XmOiFAy168781nzRAYOetg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 4a2SjXc0U4k4MRN2EdcNwg, YFYPlO4RruHZUBVe8quvOw, ZE9-b-6ekeaA9mSIt-ZTyA, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, cD9d9XFoC_bETPzjpnRj9g, R0P932lPm7Be6-YTKwwPOA, Cs6JRqxOADfeqli20F5Yhg, ZPolhetd6Od5_VhXPbFIxw, x_MbMxRc_FVlZrTqclfUyw, BuA2twnOXZOP1yQ6rqi9SQ, CZPATh5KP19TNp9sInf_rA, FDZua5BFEhEOET8e2ztkRw, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, sh1_HCgh_axTFSXoZfjqOA, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 53HVEUP1GLUEwFtespdVdQ, YwVmrb_UVy19HtDs1OwoVg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, LOpKVZIW5-66DocLLQHhhA, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, Sx2OM_pi-NsqNiZk1fMNXw, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, QmykNasFdjyaQ3K8oME3fQ, 4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A, 4YKfzKiJlque5Dd32QD-KQ, MYQ9cWCfqzE5BFEdXUv3fw, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, icf8Tr75xv-QOnI7wZX9Xw, 16TBKdpSyHma7CM5eHy99Q, XJMe4WxPhYNXKZUlZ-29NA]	Sal	808	user	{u'funny': 1209, u'useful': 2147, u'cool': 1251}	2009-01

809	HlZkklWH0SygopMt_48IIQ	2009-12-17	WW6mUVKjyXkc3vv0lnSzjg	2	"There are a lot of places that serve gyros in the area.  And everyone that I spoke to said this was the place to try -- and I spoke to a lot of people.  One fine day, I just happen to be near this location during lunch hour and figure I might as well try it.  The interior is a tad dark and dank which tends to make it feel a bit dirtier than it might have been.  The associates behind the counter were nice and were more than willing to help us.

I was happy to see the spits of gyro meat turning at the front of the store -- no precut freezer meat here.  We ordered the following at the counter:

Fries
Barqs
Plain steak pita with cheddar sauce
Gyro with tomato and tzitziki sauce on the side

Taking the rootbeer with us, we found a table.  It was a bit dirty from the previous customer and I couldn't figure out why -- the place was barren. The food was rather quick to come to the table and looked very good.  As I normally do, I tried the meat and the sauce separately.  The meat was over-seasoned while the sauce was underseasoned.  I don't even think that it was tzitziki sauce, but I went forward with my meal.  Trying to find that balance, I began adding the sauce to the gyro.  With each bite, I had to add more sauce.  It got to the point where I didn't want to add any more sauce.  Luckily, I had added enough sauce to enjoy the gyro. 

I tried a piece of the steak pita and went back to my gyro -- the steak was full of fat and gristle while also being tough.  I didn't need to eat anymore of it.  The fries were your standard freezer fare and were fried properly -- crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

In the end, I would say that Lina G's has a better gyro.  I really don't like my gyro swimming in sauce and if I have to choose between Mike's and Lina's, it will be Lina's every day.  It is much easier to add seasoning to an unbalanced gyro with sauce than it is to remove seasoning from the meat.

Still looking for a gyro that is balanced."	review	T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 1}	3.11	{u'profile': 6, u'funny': 113, u'cute': 21, u'plain': 439, u'writer': 57, u'list': 9, u'note': 242, u'photos': 22, u'hot': 102, u'more': 40, u'cool': 189}	[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	38	[18kPq7GPye-YQ3LyKyAZPw, rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, K2PDI4_GJLUTwjq0jA2viQ, -NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ, -wOgMGHvNJHQDfqUgX19Qg, 9BApDAgV8POMQ6VffTz3aA, 1Awm0xagllRcAHi4_sNptQ, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 3rtKBEuyR7yr85ufRuYlWQ, qptKNzXrua8-WWwpp846RA, LTWY2Ee-SYu8ItVOebD3CQ, 5yBkoRI9DSKH9aMV3Vadpw, GubdNFoDAsiwE6bWIr97cQ, GUrPmYze-oF6NFDJusiSNw, BaXgT8NGTnWjNUUnOdpRWA, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, ZuQ87LQYWRw3AHj-jEiQ1Q, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, y3zerFCOqhXcmzSXtpKLfg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, d1iH2EPxYMQLbKHN03Y7XQ, z4IHuLSqhPGeiXbf0mogLg, -uslRG-oovrIkvJu2LBW2g, Milv8k4zZsoCaNFZugKtJw, GHbj_ybwEXcN4R8qt7O-cg, GD6xTWmzBozrvdpVCzzLHg, -eveIridBm0gm6hRCNKZeA, qdZOzAWV1fT6QHauVRBB2w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, cMkqpHAb4ZomwMymSQfwBQ, 43f077NnbY_-kupvfczzYg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, 7F8HLz3ErL8b7CNgQqqH9g, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, mfIngaq8vE8XmKETBEl2gw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, TI88k_ezEWaj_XZSiuBNGA, nMXCCLssk_5SBi3wp41ToQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, XmOiFAy168781nzRAYOetg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 4a2SjXc0U4k4MRN2EdcNwg, YFYPlO4RruHZUBVe8quvOw, ZE9-b-6ekeaA9mSIt-ZTyA, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, cD9d9XFoC_bETPzjpnRj9g, R0P932lPm7Be6-YTKwwPOA, Cs6JRqxOADfeqli20F5Yhg, ZPolhetd6Od5_VhXPbFIxw, x_MbMxRc_FVlZrTqclfUyw, BuA2twnOXZOP1yQ6rqi9SQ, CZPATh5KP19TNp9sInf_rA, FDZua5BFEhEOET8e2ztkRw, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, sh1_HCgh_axTFSXoZfjqOA, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 53HVEUP1GLUEwFtespdVdQ, YwVmrb_UVy19HtDs1OwoVg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, LOpKVZIW5-66DocLLQHhhA, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, Sx2OM_pi-NsqNiZk1fMNXw, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, QmykNasFdjyaQ3K8oME3fQ, 4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A, 4YKfzKiJlque5Dd32QD-KQ, MYQ9cWCfqzE5BFEdXUv3fw, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, icf8Tr75xv-QOnI7wZX9Xw, 16TBKdpSyHma7CM5eHy99Q, XJMe4WxPhYNXKZUlZ-29NA]	Sal	808	user	{u'funny': 1209, u'useful': 2147, u'cool': 1251}	2009-01

Ham and cheese omelet
Two eggs, bacon, toast, home fries
Wedding soup
Pancake

The soup came out first and I tried it. Anyone that has read a small number of my reviews knows that I have an aversion to items that taste too salty and that I have a fairly sensitive tongue when it comes to salt. The soup was so bland, I actually added salt to it. Yes, that is right, I added salt to an item. After the added salt, it actually had an okay flavor about it.

Breakfast is a fairly difficult meal to destroy or get wrong, and 1889 cafe did fine. They didn't destroy the meal, but they also didn't make it memorable. As my partner would say, ""It wasn't made with love.""

813	m_nunIk_4iHZM39N6ejsyg	2009-12-04	GTOKKUspNdeVsL-FW9wBng	2	"I went in with very low expectations.  Knowing the other reviews, one would ask why I decided to come to Tom's Diner.  The answer, they have hot roast beef sandwiches and my friend really wanted a good one badly.  Not a lot of people order this entree so there was the possibility that it would be good.  That being said, we entered into the contrived, 1950's ambiance and made our way to one of the booths on the side metal wall.  It did take a bit for our waitress to finally notice us, but she brought the menus as soon as she stopped talking to the other servers and cooks in the rear.  We ordered our cokes and as she left to get the drinks we looked over the menus, intent on having our order ready by the time she came back with our drinks.  When she arrived we placed our order for the following:

Italian Wedding Soup
Hot roast beef with fries
Buffalo Chicken strips {hot}
Large gyro with no lettuce and sauce on the side.

The last two items were both entrees and I ordered both for myself since I figured one of them would be good and one of them might not be so good.  I love both gyros and buffalo chicken strips and I tend to be very forgiving of issues in their preparation because of how much I love them.  

The service so far had been very slow.  The arrival of the soup did nothing to reverse my thought on this issue.  The Italian Wedding Soup was not the worst I had ever tried, but it definitely wasn't the best.  It lacked flavor that you expect in an Italian Wedding -- one could get the same flavor from a packet of chicken broth.  My chicken strips arrived to the table and I immediately went for them.  

The strips smelled good and looked good -- not too wet, not too dry.  I tried some of the blue cheese -- not so good, I would stay away from this dressing.  I took a bit of a chicken strip and it wasn't bad; it was made from dry, white meat and it wasn't hot.  Maybe Pittsburgh hot, but it was between mild and medium (closer to mild) at best for the rest for me -- remember, it takes a serrano pepper for me to feel a tingle. I wasn't displeased with the strips, but I had definitely had better.  

The gyro and the hot roast beef sandwich arrived.  I was happy to have what appeared to be some good looking food.  The issue is that all of the food had looked good so far, while the actual flavor had been underwhelming.  As is my norm, I tried the separate parts first to see what kind of flavor each had.  Trying the gyro sauce, I can honestly say that it wasn't traditional.  The sauce was just ranch.  I really don't care for ranch.  I tried some of the meat and the pita; the meat was under-seasoned and the pita was hard on the outside and chewy on the inside (not good chewy, either).  

I moved on to the open-faced roast beef sandwich.  It didn't taste bad, but like the wedding soup it also didn't taste good.  I went back to my gyro and finished it with ranch strategically placed.  Throughout the entire ordeal of tasting the food, my cup went dry.  And it stayed dry -- for a long time.  I eventually had to ask one of the other servers in the restaurant since my server was ignoring my flailing arms in the rear of the restaurant.  

As bad as the gyro was, I can honestly say it wasn't the worst that I had ever tried -- Stoupsy's in Miami holds that special place in my heart.  Overall it was a lackluster experience that I really don't want to repeat.  I might return if someone really wants to go.  If I do go back, I would just get the buffalo chicken strips appetizer."	review	T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ	{u'funny': 4, u'useful': 5, u'cool': 3}	3.11	{u'profile': 6, u'funny': 113, u'cute': 21, u'plain': 439, u'writer': 57, u'list': 9, u'note': 242, u'photos': 22, u'hot': 102, u'more': 40, u'cool': 189}	[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	38	[18kPq7GPye-YQ3LyKyAZPw, rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, K2PDI4_GJLUTwjq0jA2viQ, -NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ, -wOgMGHvNJHQDfqUgX19Qg, 9BApDAgV8POMQ6VffTz3aA, 1Awm0xagllRcAHi4_sNptQ, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 3rtKBEuyR7yr85ufRuYlWQ, qptKNzXrua8-WWwpp846RA, LTWY2Ee-SYu8ItVOebD3CQ, 5yBkoRI9DSKH9aMV3Vadpw, GubdNFoDAsiwE6bWIr97cQ, GUrPmYze-oF6NFDJusiSNw, BaXgT8NGTnWjNUUnOdpRWA, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, ZuQ87LQYWRw3AHj-jEiQ1Q, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, y3zerFCOqhXcmzSXtpKLfg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, d1iH2EPxYMQLbKHN03Y7XQ, z4IHuLSqhPGeiXbf0mogLg, -uslRG-oovrIkvJu2LBW2g, Milv8k4zZsoCaNFZugKtJw, GHbj_ybwEXcN4R8qt7O-cg, GD6xTWmzBozrvdpVCzzLHg, -eveIridBm0gm6hRCNKZeA, qdZOzAWV1fT6QHauVRBB2w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, cMkqpHAb4ZomwMymSQfwBQ, 43f077NnbY_-kupvfczzYg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, 7F8HLz3ErL8b7CNgQqqH9g, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, mfIngaq8vE8XmKETBEl2gw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, TI88k_ezEWaj_XZSiuBNGA, nMXCCLssk_5SBi3wp41ToQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, XmOiFAy168781nzRAYOetg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 4a2SjXc0U4k4MRN2EdcNwg, YFYPlO4RruHZUBVe8quvOw, ZE9-b-6ekeaA9mSIt-ZTyA, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, cD9d9XFoC_bETPzjpnRj9g, R0P932lPm7Be6-YTKwwPOA, Cs6JRqxOADfeqli20F5Yhg, ZPolhetd6Od5_VhXPbFIxw, x_MbMxRc_FVlZrTqclfUyw, BuA2twnOXZOP1yQ6rqi9SQ, CZPATh5KP19TNp9sInf_rA, FDZua5BFEhEOET8e2ztkRw, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, sh1_HCgh_axTFSXoZfjqOA, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 53HVEUP1GLUEwFtespdVdQ, YwVmrb_UVy19HtDs1OwoVg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, LOpKVZIW5-66DocLLQHhhA, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, Sx2OM_pi-NsqNiZk1fMNXw, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, QmykNasFdjyaQ3K8oME3fQ, 4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A, 4YKfzKiJlque5Dd32QD-KQ, MYQ9cWCfqzE5BFEdXUv3fw, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, icf8Tr75xv-QOnI7wZX9Xw, 16TBKdpSyHma7CM5eHy99Q, XJMe4WxPhYNXKZUlZ-29NA]	Sal	808	user	{u'funny': 1209, u'useful': 2147, u'cool': 1251}	2009-01

Cool.

Quirky.

Bohemian.

Coffee that tastes better than Starbucks.  

Friendly people.

Really, though, this is an awesome place.  I haven't een here in years and it has actually gotten better.  I am a tad square for the Bohemian atmosphere, but I will continue to return in the hopes of some of the atmosphere rubbing off on me.  The coffee was smooth and had only a hint of bitterness -- quite nice.  It was a bit weak, but I expected that considering it was a medium roast.

Since the last time I was here, they have cordoned off the ""third room"" where all of the smokers congregate.

I need those ""fall-back"" places for times that I am ambivalent to the world.  Today, we ordered the following items:

Butternut squash soup
Chicken spaetzle soup
Ham egg and cheddar on toasted onion bagel
Chicken chipotle club on toasted onion bagel minus lettuce (use the Turkey Chipotle Club as a base)

Being from Florida, the soups were a hot welcome -- I was SO cold today.  The chicken spaetzle soup -- think chicken noodle with the noodles replaced with dumplings -- was rather good.  It wasn't too salty and the spaetzle wasn't mushy.  I wouldn't rave about the flavor of the broth, but I enjoyed what I ate.  The butternut squash soup, while lumpy and stringy, had a nice flavor with a slight piquancy to it.  It is amazing that the butternut squash soup can taste better at Bruegger's than at Season 52.  

Since I am picky and finicky about what I eat, I special ordered my chicken bagel-wich.  It took a little bit longer to make, but I am used to that -- it's a special order, what do you expect.  The staff was up to the task and were all blunt and to the point with everything they said; my kind of people.  

By no means gourmet, the bagel-wiches still had good flavor.  There was no undue piquancy in the chipotle, just some flavor to compliment the chicken and the tomato.  The addition of the toasted onion bagel was nice.  The ham, egg, and cheddar was average; but for being in downtown Pittsburgh -- and unable to make it home -- it is a passable substitute.  

I will definitely return."	review	T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	3.11	{u'profile': 6, u'funny': 113, u'cute': 21, u'plain': 439, u'writer': 57, u'list': 9, u'note': 242, u'photos': 22, u'hot': 102, u'more': 40, u'cool': 189}	[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	38	[18kPq7GPye-YQ3LyKyAZPw, rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, K2PDI4_GJLUTwjq0jA2viQ, -NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ, -wOgMGHvNJHQDfqUgX19Qg, 9BApDAgV8POMQ6VffTz3aA, 1Awm0xagllRcAHi4_sNptQ, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 3rtKBEuyR7yr85ufRuYlWQ, qptKNzXrua8-WWwpp846RA, LTWY2Ee-SYu8ItVOebD3CQ, 5yBkoRI9DSKH9aMV3Vadpw, GubdNFoDAsiwE6bWIr97cQ, GUrPmYze-oF6NFDJusiSNw, BaXgT8NGTnWjNUUnOdpRWA, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, ZuQ87LQYWRw3AHj-jEiQ1Q, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, y3zerFCOqhXcmzSXtpKLfg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, d1iH2EPxYMQLbKHN03Y7XQ, z4IHuLSqhPGeiXbf0mogLg, -uslRG-oovrIkvJu2LBW2g, Milv8k4zZsoCaNFZugKtJw, GHbj_ybwEXcN4R8qt7O-cg, GD6xTWmzBozrvdpVCzzLHg, -eveIridBm0gm6hRCNKZeA, qdZOzAWV1fT6QHauVRBB2w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, cMkqpHAb4ZomwMymSQfwBQ, 43f077NnbY_-kupvfczzYg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, 7F8HLz3ErL8b7CNgQqqH9g, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, mfIngaq8vE8XmKETBEl2gw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, TI88k_ezEWaj_XZSiuBNGA, nMXCCLssk_5SBi3wp41ToQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, XmOiFAy168781nzRAYOetg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 4a2SjXc0U4k4MRN2EdcNwg, YFYPlO4RruHZUBVe8quvOw, ZE9-b-6ekeaA9mSIt-ZTyA, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, cD9d9XFoC_bETPzjpnRj9g, R0P932lPm7Be6-YTKwwPOA, Cs6JRqxOADfeqli20F5Yhg, ZPolhetd6Od5_VhXPbFIxw, x_MbMxRc_FVlZrTqclfUyw, BuA2twnOXZOP1yQ6rqi9SQ, CZPATh5KP19TNp9sInf_rA, FDZua5BFEhEOET8e2ztkRw, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, sh1_HCgh_axTFSXoZfjqOA, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 53HVEUP1GLUEwFtespdVdQ, YwVmrb_UVy19HtDs1OwoVg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, LOpKVZIW5-66DocLLQHhhA, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, Sx2OM_pi-NsqNiZk1fMNXw, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, QmykNasFdjyaQ3K8oME3fQ, 4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A, 4YKfzKiJlque5Dd32QD-KQ, MYQ9cWCfqzE5BFEdXUv3fw, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, icf8Tr75xv-QOnI7wZX9Xw, 16TBKdpSyHma7CM5eHy99Q, XJMe4WxPhYNXKZUlZ-29NA]	Sal	808	user	{u'funny': 1209, u'useful': 2147, u'cool': 1251}	2009-01

I was in the area about three years ago and many of the smaller Mom and Pop diners that I actually liked had closed.  Thankfully this place was still open and I was hungry.  Located near the top of Mount Washington, this little diner benefits by its proximity to the Mount Washington Parking garage.

Rather stark inside, the locals and owners like to dress up the interior and exterior for the holidays.  While we were looked at suspiciously at first, we were accepted into the fold when we placed our order:

Chicken and rice soup
Ham and cheese with homefries
Big Country Breakfast: eggs (poached medium), bacon (soft), and blueberry pancakes with toast and homefries

The chicken and rice soup had very little chicken and A LOT of vegetables and the broth was rather flavorless.  I would like to take this time to rename it to Vegetable and Rice soup -- now if only it had some flavor.  As we muddled through the soup, our entrees came to the table.  Did I mention I was hungry?  The Big Country Breakfast looked great.

I went straight for the blueberry pancakes and enjoyed their flavor.  They were good and fluffy and the blueberries had good flavor that just popped in my mouth.  After eating about a quarter of them I moved on to the  eggs.  They were cooked perfectly -- egg whites fully solid and the yolk slightly viscous in the center.  I love eggs when they are cooked perfectly like this since a majority of the yolk will adhere to the whites and then I can come in with my toast and mop up the rest.  OH SO GOOD! And back to the pancakes....then the eggs...and then the bacon.  They listened to me and brought out my bacon soft.  I swear that I am the only person in the world that dislikes crunchy bacon.

I looked over at the omelet but decided not to try it.  It had been browned.  I know it is a psychological thing, but if my eggs are browned I will not touch them.  I will accept my friends comments that it was good.  He finished it and appeared to enjoy it.  The only other down point about the meal were the homefries -- not a lot of flavor to them at all.  I decided to just leave them at the side and eat the rest of my meal.

I enjoyed this experience and will return from time to time.  Even though there is the garage, it can be hectic to find a parking space.  I think that the only reason I would choose this diner over O'Leary's is the pancakes.  They were so much better.  That is fine, though, I go to O'Leary's for the French Toast."	review	T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 2}	3.11	{u'profile': 6, u'funny': 113, u'cute': 21, u'plain': 439, u'writer': 57, u'list': 9, u'note': 242, u'photos': 22, u'hot': 102, u'more': 40, u'cool': 189}	[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	38	[18kPq7GPye-YQ3LyKyAZPw, rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, K2PDI4_GJLUTwjq0jA2viQ, -NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ, -wOgMGHvNJHQDfqUgX19Qg, 9BApDAgV8POMQ6VffTz3aA, 1Awm0xagllRcAHi4_sNptQ, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 3rtKBEuyR7yr85ufRuYlWQ, qptKNzXrua8-WWwpp846RA, LTWY2Ee-SYu8ItVOebD3CQ, 5yBkoRI9DSKH9aMV3Vadpw, GubdNFoDAsiwE6bWIr97cQ, GUrPmYze-oF6NFDJusiSNw, BaXgT8NGTnWjNUUnOdpRWA, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, ZuQ87LQYWRw3AHj-jEiQ1Q, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, y3zerFCOqhXcmzSXtpKLfg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, d1iH2EPxYMQLbKHN03Y7XQ, z4IHuLSqhPGeiXbf0mogLg, -uslRG-oovrIkvJu2LBW2g, Milv8k4zZsoCaNFZugKtJw, GHbj_ybwEXcN4R8qt7O-cg, GD6xTWmzBozrvdpVCzzLHg, -eveIridBm0gm6hRCNKZeA, qdZOzAWV1fT6QHauVRBB2w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, cMkqpHAb4ZomwMymSQfwBQ, 43f077NnbY_-kupvfczzYg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, 7F8HLz3ErL8b7CNgQqqH9g, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, mfIngaq8vE8XmKETBEl2gw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, TI88k_ezEWaj_XZSiuBNGA, nMXCCLssk_5SBi3wp41ToQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, XmOiFAy168781nzRAYOetg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 4a2SjXc0U4k4MRN2EdcNwg, YFYPlO4RruHZUBVe8quvOw, ZE9-b-6ekeaA9mSIt-ZTyA, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, cD9d9XFoC_bETPzjpnRj9g, R0P932lPm7Be6-YTKwwPOA, Cs6JRqxOADfeqli20F5Yhg, ZPolhetd6Od5_VhXPbFIxw, x_MbMxRc_FVlZrTqclfUyw, BuA2twnOXZOP1yQ6rqi9SQ, CZPATh5KP19TNp9sInf_rA, FDZua5BFEhEOET8e2ztkRw, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, sh1_HCgh_axTFSXoZfjqOA, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 53HVEUP1GLUEwFtespdVdQ, YwVmrb_UVy19HtDs1OwoVg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, LOpKVZIW5-66DocLLQHhhA, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, Sx2OM_pi-NsqNiZk1fMNXw, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, QmykNasFdjyaQ3K8oME3fQ, 4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A, 4YKfzKiJlque5Dd32QD-KQ, MYQ9cWCfqzE5BFEdXUv3fw, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, icf8Tr75xv-QOnI7wZX9Xw, 16TBKdpSyHma7CM5eHy99Q, XJMe4WxPhYNXKZUlZ-29NA]	Sal	808	user	{u'funny': 1209, u'useful': 2147, u'cool': 1251}	2009-01
819	9oImwXLAn-DFppBrfbmkLg	2009-12-06	to_8uxgfz9IBMyeLkr2Faw	4	"Located in Duquesne Heights, you must visit this restaurant.  If for nothing else, just the night time view of downtown Pittsburgh.  It was wonderful.  There is an upper and a lower level to this restaurant.  The upper-level is fairly pretentious and filled with lots of glitz and suits.  The lower-level is where the bar is located and it contains a small amount of window seating.  Many people go to sit upstairs.  Why?  I don't know.  It is so bright and contrived and you cannot get a very good view.  I prefer the darker lower level where people are more down to earth and real and the fact that you can actually see the city lit up at night. Don't let the coat check fool you.  If you feel uncomfortable, just head to the lower level.

We were greeted by our server and handed the menus.  We were able to look through and asked our server for her suggestions.  We placed our order for the recommended  appetizer that was not on the menu: 

Combo Platter: Ichiban (tuna, salmon, and swordfish grilled on a skewer), Crabcake, and Cajun shrimp

I was continually distracted by the view.  You can see the Duquesne Incline, the Southside, Downtown and the Northside and it is amazing how the night coupled with lit buildings can create such a sublime and dramatic image on the horizon -- Beautiful.   I had to focus, though, and was ready for our server when she returned with the appetizer:

French onion soup
Butternut squash soup
Mahi mahi with garlic- feta mashed potatoes
Yellow fin tuna with, garlic-feta mashed potatoes, and tomatoes with balsamic vinaigrette

The tri-partite appetizer combined three of the more popular appetizers on the written menu.  I was quite glad they had this option tonight since I would have been very disappointed to have ordered the Ichiban and the Cajun shrimp as their own dish.  Both were not great and were lacking in flavor.  The fish cubes on the Ichiban skewer were somewhat tough and overcooked with very little flavor.  The shrimp were slightly rubbery and did not taste Cajun.  The price of this appetizer was only $1 more than the crab cake appetizer.  The crab cake was quite good.  It is the best crab cake I have had in the Pittsburgh area.  It was well cooked, moist, tasted of lump crab and had minimal filler.

As we were finishing the appetizer the soups and tomatoes appeared.  My butternut squash soup came in a two-part series to preserve the scant heat in the soup itself and to protect the crab that came at the bottom of my bowl.  The soup was poured over the seeds and crab at the table.  It tasted very good, but unfortunately it cooled rather quickly -- this is on of the issues with Creme Fraiche, you cannot over heat or it will curdle.  I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor of the squash in the smooth soup coupled with the fresh crab, pumpkin seed, and creme fraiche.  The French Onion soup had a good flavor. Not over-seasoned, the onions were actually cooked, and a good consomme as its base.  

Our dinners arrived and I was surprised by the size.  The portions were quite large for both entrees and one could have easily been split between two people.  A bit apprehensive after the Ichiban, I tried the tuna to find that the flavor was much better for the entree.  The same held true for the mahi-mahi.  The tuna was cooked to a nice medium rare, had good texture and flavor and was not filled with gristle.  The mahi-mahi was tender, moist, and flavorful.  The blackening seasoning had a good flavor and was mildly piquant.  

I moved on to the mashed potatoes and my tomatoes.  There was just a hint of the feta and garlic in the potatoes that complimented the potatoes very well.  The tomatoes were good and the vinaigrette was also tasty.  I do wish that they would have used a better oil and vinegar, though.  The oil was a cheaper brand without much flavor and the balsamic was fairly weak, but with good flavor.  

Unable to finish our meals, we decided that we wouldn't bother with desserts.  Next time -- and there will be a next time -- the appetizer will be crab cake only and we will be splitting a meal.  With more than enough food for two, this will also cut the bill considerably.  I will continue to sit on the lower level and I hope that I get our server again."	review	T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 3}	3.11	{u'profile': 6, u'funny': 113, u'cute': 21, u'plain': 439, u'writer': 57, u'list': 9, u'note': 242, u'photos': 22, u'hot': 102, u'more': 40, u'cool': 189}	[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	38	[18kPq7GPye-YQ3LyKyAZPw, rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, K2PDI4_GJLUTwjq0jA2viQ, -NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ, -wOgMGHvNJHQDfqUgX19Qg, 9BApDAgV8POMQ6VffTz3aA, 1Awm0xagllRcAHi4_sNptQ, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 3rtKBEuyR7yr85ufRuYlWQ, qptKNzXrua8-WWwpp846RA, LTWY2Ee-SYu8ItVOebD3CQ, 5yBkoRI9DSKH9aMV3Vadpw, GubdNFoDAsiwE6bWIr97cQ, GUrPmYze-oF6NFDJusiSNw, BaXgT8NGTnWjNUUnOdpRWA, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, ZuQ87LQYWRw3AHj-jEiQ1Q, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, y3zerFCOqhXcmzSXtpKLfg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, d1iH2EPxYMQLbKHN03Y7XQ, z4IHuLSqhPGeiXbf0mogLg, -uslRG-oovrIkvJu2LBW2g, Milv8k4zZsoCaNFZugKtJw, GHbj_ybwEXcN4R8qt7O-cg, GD6xTWmzBozrvdpVCzzLHg, -eveIridBm0gm6hRCNKZeA, qdZOzAWV1fT6QHauVRBB2w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, cMkqpHAb4ZomwMymSQfwBQ, 43f077NnbY_-kupvfczzYg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, 7F8HLz3ErL8b7CNgQqqH9g, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, mfIngaq8vE8XmKETBEl2gw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, TI88k_ezEWaj_XZSiuBNGA, nMXCCLssk_5SBi3wp41ToQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, XmOiFAy168781nzRAYOetg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 4a2SjXc0U4k4MRN2EdcNwg, YFYPlO4RruHZUBVe8quvOw, ZE9-b-6ekeaA9mSIt-ZTyA, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, cD9d9XFoC_bETPzjpnRj9g, R0P932lPm7Be6-YTKwwPOA, Cs6JRqxOADfeqli20F5Yhg, ZPolhetd6Od5_VhXPbFIxw, x_MbMxRc_FVlZrTqclfUyw, BuA2twnOXZOP1yQ6rqi9SQ, CZPATh5KP19TNp9sInf_rA, FDZua5BFEhEOET8e2ztkRw, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, sh1_HCgh_axTFSXoZfjqOA, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 53HVEUP1GLUEwFtespdVdQ, YwVmrb_UVy19HtDs1OwoVg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, LOpKVZIW5-66DocLLQHhhA, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, Sx2OM_pi-NsqNiZk1fMNXw, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, QmykNasFdjyaQ3K8oME3fQ, 4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A, 4YKfzKiJlque5Dd32QD-KQ, MYQ9cWCfqzE5BFEdXUv3fw, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, icf8Tr75xv-QOnI7wZX9Xw, 16TBKdpSyHma7CM5eHy99Q, XJMe4WxPhYNXKZUlZ-29NA]	Sal	808	user	{u'funny': 1209, u'useful': 2147, u'cool': 1251}	2009-01
820	63M2e_wSmQ8GbLDUau5K6Q	2011-07-10	K06OhFCp9zBiCuRITJsRfg	2	"So many great reviews, so many wonderful comments I have read about this restaurant.  My neighbor personally recommended trying out La Tavola, and so I did.  As with the rest of Mt Washington, parking will either be a pain in the butt or valet.  I arrived at 9:00pm on a Friday night and was lucky enough to find close street parking.  

They appeared to have been fairly busy earlier in the day and night, but when I entered about half the tables were empty.  The interior was rather non-descript and I recognized the wall ornamentation from Ross and Marshalls.  We waited for about five minutes before we were seated.  This didn't bother me since all of the servers I saw were moving quick and making rounds to all of their tables and helping each other clean-up.  I was more worried that I would be sat at a table in a corner and lost in that shuffle.  Miraculously, we were sat a two-top in the middle of the entire main dining area.  

All of the servers were hustling and bustling and doing what they do and I saw people smiling and laughing with the exception of one that was just talking to one of his tables.  After 15 minutes of waiting and not seeing anyone, I did start to get a tad irritated.  I wondered if the only server that was talking with one of his tables rather than serving or helping the other servers was our server.  I started to stare in his direction and he looked at me a couple of times before something in his head clicked.  He came over and asked if we had been served and I told him no.  He left, returned in a few minutes and apologized.  He was our server.  As we had been waiting for 20 minutes, we new EVERYTHING that we wanted and ordered:

Pepsi
Tea with Lemon
Meatballs as an appetizer
Wedding Soup (in place of salad)
Veal Piccata (no mushrooms) with a side of potatoes 
Veal Parmagiana with linguine and red sauce

Our server seemed perturbed that we already knew what we wanted and didn't want to listen to the specials.  Not only did he have a poor attitude from his first contact, but he didn't write anything down.  I didn't order any additional appetizers due to those two facts.  Our server promptly disappeared and we didn't see him for another ten minutes.  I saw every other server in the place several times.  Some of them even stopped to help us and bring bread -- they were all very nice people.  We finally received our drinks -- a Pepsi for my friend and I.  I asked the server if I could have the tea I ordered. He apologized and said he didn't know how he could have forgotten since he had commented earlier on how the kitchen had just brewed a fresh batch.

And then the waiting started anew.  Our server didn't visit our table again for the next thirty minutes.  He would disappear.  He would stop and chat with other tables.  He would stand around and look as all of the other servers were running around, serving, and also helping to clean our server's tables.  He never helped with anyone else.  Thankfully the other servers refilled our drinks and brought bread to us.  We even managed to get the wedding soup from one of the other servers.  It was good.  It had more of a spinach flavor than many other Wedding soups I have eaten, but it was good.  Alas, we never saw our meatballs.

Our food finally arrived.  The serving sizes were a wonderful size.  I was really not liking our server; but that was fine since I had been craving a good piccata for some time.  I wasn't even perturbed by the fact that I had broccoli instead of the potatoes the server stated came with my meal.  As I dug in, I was left in dismay.  The piccata didn't taste of lemon, capers, or wine in any way.  It tasted like a heavy, flour gravy.  To top it off my food wasn't hot, but tepid or lukewarm.

I tried some of my friends veal parmagiana.  I then went to try some of his linguine to find that it was spaghetti.  I didn't hate it, but the red sauce had a weird aftertaste akin to the metallic aftertaste I get from artificial sweeteners.  I finished my food.

I saw several dessert trays being sent to a larger party in the room next door, and the desserts looked good.  I was by no means full and could have eaten more; but I just didn't want to have to deal with this server anymore.  I can't help but wonder if Rachel C. had the same server I had.  

So why I haven't I given 1 star?  A 1 star would mean that I would most likely never return, my friend didn't hate his food and I know that piccata is a difficult dish to make.  I think my experience was greatly colored by one of the worst servers I have ever had.  I will return at some point and make certain to try a different food and to get a different server."	review	T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 1}	3.11	{u'profile': 6, u'funny': 113, u'cute': 21, u'plain': 439, u'writer': 57, u'list': 9, u'note': 242, u'photos': 22, u'hot': 102, u'more': 40, u'cool': 189}	[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	38	[18kPq7GPye-YQ3LyKyAZPw, rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, K2PDI4_GJLUTwjq0jA2viQ, -NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ, -wOgMGHvNJHQDfqUgX19Qg, 9BApDAgV8POMQ6VffTz3aA, 1Awm0xagllRcAHi4_sNptQ, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 3rtKBEuyR7yr85ufRuYlWQ, qptKNzXrua8-WWwpp846RA, LTWY2Ee-SYu8ItVOebD3CQ, 5yBkoRI9DSKH9aMV3Vadpw, GubdNFoDAsiwE6bWIr97cQ, GUrPmYze-oF6NFDJusiSNw, BaXgT8NGTnWjNUUnOdpRWA, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, ZuQ87LQYWRw3AHj-jEiQ1Q, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, y3zerFCOqhXcmzSXtpKLfg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, d1iH2EPxYMQLbKHN03Y7XQ, z4IHuLSqhPGeiXbf0mogLg, -uslRG-oovrIkvJu2LBW2g, Milv8k4zZsoCaNFZugKtJw, GHbj_ybwEXcN4R8qt7O-cg, GD6xTWmzBozrvdpVCzzLHg, -eveIridBm0gm6hRCNKZeA, qdZOzAWV1fT6QHauVRBB2w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, cMkqpHAb4ZomwMymSQfwBQ, 43f077NnbY_-kupvfczzYg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, 7F8HLz3ErL8b7CNgQqqH9g, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, mfIngaq8vE8XmKETBEl2gw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, TI88k_ezEWaj_XZSiuBNGA, nMXCCLssk_5SBi3wp41ToQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, XmOiFAy168781nzRAYOetg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 4a2SjXc0U4k4MRN2EdcNwg, YFYPlO4RruHZUBVe8quvOw, ZE9-b-6ekeaA9mSIt-ZTyA, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, cD9d9XFoC_bETPzjpnRj9g, R0P932lPm7Be6-YTKwwPOA, Cs6JRqxOADfeqli20F5Yhg, ZPolhetd6Od5_VhXPbFIxw, x_MbMxRc_FVlZrTqclfUyw, BuA2twnOXZOP1yQ6rqi9SQ, CZPATh5KP19TNp9sInf_rA, FDZua5BFEhEOET8e2ztkRw, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, sh1_HCgh_axTFSXoZfjqOA, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 53HVEUP1GLUEwFtespdVdQ, YwVmrb_UVy19HtDs1OwoVg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, LOpKVZIW5-66DocLLQHhhA, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, Sx2OM_pi-NsqNiZk1fMNXw, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, QmykNasFdjyaQ3K8oME3fQ, 4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A, 4YKfzKiJlque5Dd32QD-KQ, MYQ9cWCfqzE5BFEdXUv3fw, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, icf8Tr75xv-QOnI7wZX9Xw, 16TBKdpSyHma7CM5eHy99Q, XJMe4WxPhYNXKZUlZ-29NA]	Sal	808	user	{u'funny': 1209, u'useful': 2147, u'cool': 1251}	2009-01
821	Ca-003BAqWW-IEsFvjlY9g	2013-11-30	JKusrXmJyWZ06-IHefFOug	5	"I love Rose Tea cafe. They have the best milk teas and their tapioca pearls are always properly cooked. I will routinely stop in to order my Almond Milk Tea with Tapioca Pearls and light sweetener. So much, in fact, that most of the people that work here recognize me and/or know what I am going to order.

I came in many times for my milk tea yet never stopped to try the food for the longest time. I did get to see the food pass by as I waited for my bubble tea to be made. It always looked and smelled so great that I finally decided to stop in before a movie one night.  Since that first dinner, I have stopped by several more times for dinner. We always get the Yeung Chow fried rice and fried dumplings. The fried rice is some of the best in the area, while the dumplings are passable.

I have tried several of the dinners on the menu: pork belly with kimchee, stewed pork belly, spicy chicken in a casserole, and spicy short ribs. I have really enjoyed all of them. The flavors are all rather wonderful. I am still looking for that dinner entree that I crave, but I know I will continue to return due to my craving for the Almond Milk Tea with Pearls."	review	T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.11	{u'profile': 6, u'funny': 113, u'cute': 21, u'plain': 439, u'writer': 57, u'list': 9, u'note': 242, u'photos': 22, u'hot': 102, u'more': 40, u'cool': 189}	[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	38	[18kPq7GPye-YQ3LyKyAZPw, rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, K2PDI4_GJLUTwjq0jA2viQ, -NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ, -wOgMGHvNJHQDfqUgX19Qg, 9BApDAgV8POMQ6VffTz3aA, 1Awm0xagllRcAHi4_sNptQ, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 3rtKBEuyR7yr85ufRuYlWQ, qptKNzXrua8-WWwpp846RA, LTWY2Ee-SYu8ItVOebD3CQ, 5yBkoRI9DSKH9aMV3Vadpw, GubdNFoDAsiwE6bWIr97cQ, GUrPmYze-oF6NFDJusiSNw, BaXgT8NGTnWjNUUnOdpRWA, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, ZuQ87LQYWRw3AHj-jEiQ1Q, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, y3zerFCOqhXcmzSXtpKLfg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, d1iH2EPxYMQLbKHN03Y7XQ, z4IHuLSqhPGeiXbf0mogLg, -uslRG-oovrIkvJu2LBW2g, Milv8k4zZsoCaNFZugKtJw, GHbj_ybwEXcN4R8qt7O-cg, GD6xTWmzBozrvdpVCzzLHg, -eveIridBm0gm6hRCNKZeA, qdZOzAWV1fT6QHauVRBB2w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, cMkqpHAb4ZomwMymSQfwBQ, 43f077NnbY_-kupvfczzYg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, 7F8HLz3ErL8b7CNgQqqH9g, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, mfIngaq8vE8XmKETBEl2gw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, TI88k_ezEWaj_XZSiuBNGA, nMXCCLssk_5SBi3wp41ToQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, XmOiFAy168781nzRAYOetg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 4a2SjXc0U4k4MRN2EdcNwg, YFYPlO4RruHZUBVe8quvOw, ZE9-b-6ekeaA9mSIt-ZTyA, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, cD9d9XFoC_bETPzjpnRj9g, R0P932lPm7Be6-YTKwwPOA, Cs6JRqxOADfeqli20F5Yhg, ZPolhetd6Od5_VhXPbFIxw, x_MbMxRc_FVlZrTqclfUyw, BuA2twnOXZOP1yQ6rqi9SQ, CZPATh5KP19TNp9sInf_rA, FDZua5BFEhEOET8e2ztkRw, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, sh1_HCgh_axTFSXoZfjqOA, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 53HVEUP1GLUEwFtespdVdQ, YwVmrb_UVy19HtDs1OwoVg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, LOpKVZIW5-66DocLLQHhhA, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, Sx2OM_pi-NsqNiZk1fMNXw, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, QmykNasFdjyaQ3K8oME3fQ, 4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A, 4YKfzKiJlque5Dd32QD-KQ, MYQ9cWCfqzE5BFEdXUv3fw, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, icf8Tr75xv-QOnI7wZX9Xw, 16TBKdpSyHma7CM5eHy99Q, XJMe4WxPhYNXKZUlZ-29NA]	Sal	808	user	{u'funny': 1209, u'useful': 2147, u'cool': 1251}	2009-01
822	1vK7gWQ_b5ehAyOidOsYtg	2013-08-18	qgjNPwxI5NeHTCDtLV-xTQ	1	"Let me start by saying that I don't like an over abundance of seasonings in my food. There must always be a balance between base and spice and the smaller the number of base ingredients, the more precarious that balance becomes. My preference is in direct contrast to my mother, since she LOVES a lot of the typical Italian American spices in abundance. I am not my mother.

Upon entering Aiello's, one can see the typical decor of this pizza parlor. Everything is plastic, white, and sterile and I'm direct contrast to the warm, wooden interiors of Mineo's. I put in our dinner order at the counter:

Italian Wedding Soup
Small Pizza With Pepperoni
Small Stromboli: Pepperoni Steak Bacon and Meatball; sauce on the side
Bottled Water

The Wedding Soup arrived rather hot (microwaved) and in a styrofoam container. I am always wary of styrofoam adding flavor, but it didn't in this case. The soup was actually rather tasty and we split it between the two of us. I do have a fondness for a wedding soup that has a strong cheese flavor to it. 

Our pizza was the next to arrive and looking at it I was a tad distressed as I could see all of the added seasoning and all of the seasoning in the sauce. I took a piece hoping the heat would sterilize the flavor of what appeared to be excess spice. I ate the entire piece but was not pleased. I took another piece to see if the cooling process had amplified the flavor and found that it had. I decided to wait on the stromboli.  I looked at my friend and asked him what he thought and he just grimaced. He is much more forgiving of over seasoned items than I am and he still stopped eating the pizza in favor of waiting for the stromboli. 

When our stromboli arrived, I was happy that I ordered the sauce on the side. I served a piece to my friend and found, much to my chagrin, that sauce had also been placed inside the food. I had already committed both of us to trying the pizza pastry by this point and decided to move forward. What I tasted made me stop eating. Not only had they put sauce on the inside, but they had put a lot of extra Italian seasoning on the inside. 

I don't know how people can eat this much Italian spice. I can only assume that the people that like this spicing of their food also like to eat spoonfuls of Italian seasoning out of the spice jar in the cupboard. If not for the Italian Wedding soup I would really want to give this parlor a zero star.

""The cheese is so thick it's like eating a steak!""

Those are not my words. Those are the words uttered by a lifetime fan of Mineo's when I asked him where I can find the best pizza and why. I was so perplexed by his use of the word ""nasty"" in such a positive manner that I had to try the food. So after watching ""20 Feet from Stardom"" at The Manor Theater, we went to try Mineo's

Like many of the pizza parlors in the area, you must order at the counter. Our order:
Italian Wedding Soup
Meatballs Parmesan 
16"" Pepperoni Pizza

It's amazing how many people come in and out of Mineo's, most leaving with only a slice and never taking a seat. I was able to watch the interactions, comings, and goings of the other patrons as I waited in one of the wooden booths. The arrival of he soup was a welcome distraction due to my hunger.

I liked the fact that the soup was not overly complex and that the broth had a strong cheese flavor to it. So many places like to add too many extra items to an already busy soup. I was happy that Mineo's version relied on the main ingredients. I returned to people watching after finishing the soup and waited on the rest of the food to arrive.

The pizza and meatballs arrived a short time later. As hot as the pizza was, I decided to try the meatballs first so as not to scorch my mouth too bad. The flavor of the meatballs were okay. They bordered on having too much filler for my taste. The sauce was the same way, it tasted like the balance of spice to base was a but off. I ate half a meatball and left the rest for others.

I looked over at the pizza and took in the pretty image it created in my mind. I didn't see any pepperoni on it, but figured it must be in there somewhere. Taking a piece, I tested the heat and then took a bite.

""The cheese is so thick it's like eating a steak!""

That description came back to me at that moment. And it was not undercooked like so many other pizza places that like it pile on cheese. All of the cheese was melted and it was even browned and bubbling on top - big plus! The pepperoni was hidden within the vast sea of cheese. Personally, I prefer my pepperoni to be on top so that it can crisp, but the  pepperoni they used was fairly tasty even hidden from view. 

The one detractor from the pizza was the sauce. In my opinion, it was almost over seasoned. The closer I came to the crust, the thicker the sauce, and the flavor, became. I like the Italian spices, but they are easily overdone very much in the same way that cumin is overdone in many Hispanic foods.

I will be eating at Mineo's again, my friends really enjoyed the cheesiness."	review	T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 1}	3.11	{u'profile': 6, u'funny': 113, u'cute': 21, u'plain': 439, u'writer': 57, u'list': 9, u'note': 242, u'photos': 22, u'hot': 102, u'more': 40, u'cool': 189}	[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	38	[18kPq7GPye-YQ3LyKyAZPw, rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, K2PDI4_GJLUTwjq0jA2viQ, -NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ, -wOgMGHvNJHQDfqUgX19Qg, 9BApDAgV8POMQ6VffTz3aA, 1Awm0xagllRcAHi4_sNptQ, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 3rtKBEuyR7yr85ufRuYlWQ, qptKNzXrua8-WWwpp846RA, LTWY2Ee-SYu8ItVOebD3CQ, 5yBkoRI9DSKH9aMV3Vadpw, GubdNFoDAsiwE6bWIr97cQ, GUrPmYze-oF6NFDJusiSNw, BaXgT8NGTnWjNUUnOdpRWA, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, ZuQ87LQYWRw3AHj-jEiQ1Q, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, y3zerFCOqhXcmzSXtpKLfg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, d1iH2EPxYMQLbKHN03Y7XQ, z4IHuLSqhPGeiXbf0mogLg, -uslRG-oovrIkvJu2LBW2g, Milv8k4zZsoCaNFZugKtJw, GHbj_ybwEXcN4R8qt7O-cg, GD6xTWmzBozrvdpVCzzLHg, -eveIridBm0gm6hRCNKZeA, qdZOzAWV1fT6QHauVRBB2w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, cMkqpHAb4ZomwMymSQfwBQ, 43f077NnbY_-kupvfczzYg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, 7F8HLz3ErL8b7CNgQqqH9g, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, mfIngaq8vE8XmKETBEl2gw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, TI88k_ezEWaj_XZSiuBNGA, nMXCCLssk_5SBi3wp41ToQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, XmOiFAy168781nzRAYOetg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 4a2SjXc0U4k4MRN2EdcNwg, YFYPlO4RruHZUBVe8quvOw, ZE9-b-6ekeaA9mSIt-ZTyA, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, cD9d9XFoC_bETPzjpnRj9g, R0P932lPm7Be6-YTKwwPOA, Cs6JRqxOADfeqli20F5Yhg, ZPolhetd6Od5_VhXPbFIxw, x_MbMxRc_FVlZrTqclfUyw, BuA2twnOXZOP1yQ6rqi9SQ, CZPATh5KP19TNp9sInf_rA, FDZua5BFEhEOET8e2ztkRw, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, sh1_HCgh_axTFSXoZfjqOA, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 53HVEUP1GLUEwFtespdVdQ, YwVmrb_UVy19HtDs1OwoVg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, LOpKVZIW5-66DocLLQHhhA, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, Sx2OM_pi-NsqNiZk1fMNXw, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, QmykNasFdjyaQ3K8oME3fQ, 4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A, 4YKfzKiJlque5Dd32QD-KQ, MYQ9cWCfqzE5BFEdXUv3fw, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, icf8Tr75xv-QOnI7wZX9Xw, 16TBKdpSyHma7CM5eHy99Q, XJMe4WxPhYNXKZUlZ-29NA]	Sal	808	user	{u'funny': 1209, u'useful': 2147, u'cool': 1251}	2009-01

My dinner experiences have been good, but the thing that I love most is the All-You-Can-Eat Sunday Brunch buffet; I am not a person that likes buffets. A tad pricey at almost $30 a person, it is definitely worth it since all of the items are fresh. Did I mention they have prime rib?

On each of my dinner excursions, I have had something special made for me by the chef due to allergies, and each time it was really good. More often than not, though, if I am going to The Grand Concourse it is because I am at the Sunday Brunch eating prime rib. It has gotten to the point where I actually have a routine.

My comment has nothing to do with the location and everything to do with the food and the service.  I like to think that I am fairly open about assessing a new place, but the is not a Chinese restaurant.  The best thing that I can say about the entire experience is that it didn't taste bad -- there was NO flavor in anything .  Wow...really?  I can only think of the Allegory of the Cave when reading previous reviews and then to feel sorry if this is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Really?!?!?

As I was walking here, I saw that their specialty was sichuan/szechuan and hunan styles of cooking.  I thought that was awesome since I prefer szechuan style cooking.  Don't believe what you read though.  The best approximation of the the taste and texture of this food is the cheap Cantonese dishes that I ordered in Hong Kong -- the difference is that I only paid 25 cents for three times as much food.  The food we ordered:

Pan fried pork dumplings
Wonton
Egg drop
Combo fried rice (yeung chow)
Kung Pao chicken
Unsweet Tea
Coke

The service was HORRIBLE.  The server only had THREE tables and she was running around like Foghorn Leghorn after Colonel Sanders chopped off his head in Family Guy.  What made it worse is that the owner/manager was watching the entire time and not interceding to try and make the experience better.  For your benefit, I will list the order of how my order arrived:

1. Fried Rice (entree) - after 15 minutes of waiting
2. Egg Drop Soup and Wonton Soup (appetizer) - 10 minutes after the fried rice
3. Coke and Iced Tea (drinks) - 5 minutes after the soup.
4. Kung Pao Chicken (entree) - 20 minutes after our drinks arrived.
5. Dumplings (appetizer) - a good 10 minutes after the Kung Pao chicken.

I am not going to bore you with the poor excuses uttered by the waitress, at least she appeared to be trying in the best way she could.  The fact that the manager/owner was just watching the entire situation just pissed me off.  I didn't finish eating anything.  If you enjoy eating coagulated goop in differing levels of solidity, then this is the place for you.  If you don't like Chinese food because it tastes like the food at this place, please try again in a different place -- this is NOT good Chinese food.

The most amazing part was the table of 5 Chinese men that were sitting at the table next to me.  They were continually asking for items that they were not recieving.  Two of the gentlemen actually went to speak to the manager -- IN CHINESE -- and the manager still did nothing.  Horrendous. At $20 per person, this is quite overpriced.

The hard part was finding the restaurant once I arrived at Station Square.  I really don't care for the organization of this odd mall, but that is another review.  Located at the North-East corner of the complex on the second floor, Sesame Inn is easily missed.  After having called the people several times on my cell trying to figure out where they were located, I was finally able to get to the stairwell leading to the front entry.  

Unintelligible Chinese people? Check
Chinese kitsch? Check
Good Chinese Food? Read on...

So far, so good.  Everything was appearing in place and had the proper feeling.  I was craving some good Sichuan food.  We were seated by the host and I looked at the menu solely to make certain that what I wanted to order was present.  When the server arrived I asked her some quick questions to make certain that there wasn't too much of a deviation from what I was craving and ordered:

Egg drop soup
Wonton soup
Panfried pork dumplings
Combination rice (no peas or carrots)
Kung pao, extra spicy, with only peanuts and red bell peppers

Our server was quite peppy and sounded like she was a first generation American since she spoke English flawlessly to us and then spoke Chinese to people in the back.  She was quick to bring out our Iced tea, Pepsi, and soups.  I was a tad taken aback by the appearance of my egg drop soup -- it was a deep red instead of a light yellow.  I spooned it through to make certain it was the right soup and found the cause for the deviation -- the addition of tomatoes to the soup.  Feeling comfortable, I tried the soup.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  It was thick and heavy with very little of that flowered egg/broth combination that makes for a very good egg drop soup.  I could live with a thicker soup, just don't take away the flavor.  The wonton soup also had that heavier feeling about it as compared to some of the lighter wonton soups that I have tried and enjoyed.

Our panfried dumplings arrived to our table and they smelled good.  While the skins were a little thicker, they weren't dumpling thick and the meat filling helped to balance it in terms of consistency.  The flavor was a bit muted, though.  Trying the dipping sauce, I received a bit of a shock.  Contrary to everything else thus far, it was quite vibrant. The dumpling sauce had a very strong acidic flavor to it and could possibly have use a tad less vinegar in the preparation.  Together, though, I enjoyed the dumplings and dipping sauce.  And, truth be told, I would rather the sauce be a little strong on the acid than a little week since I can always dilute with some soy sauce.

Our entrees arrived and they smelled quite good; but I had to send the chicken back.  There were mushrooms.  Sorry, can't eat mushrooms.  While waiting on the chicken to return, we started on the fried rice.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  It was fully cooked, but it was a bit soggy.  The meats were somewhat flavorless and only added another texture to the whole dish.  The flavor of the dish as a whole did not transcend being rice and meat.  A good fried rice really helps me understand the adage, ""Greater than the sum of the parts.""

As we were finishing the fried rice, the new chicken arrived.  It was steaming hot and smelled good.  It looked to be more in a red sauce than a glaze as is customary with Sichuan foods.  I figured as long as it tasted good then there would be no issue.  I took my first bite.  It was sweet.  It wasn't piquant.  I had asked the server if items were spicy.  I had asked her about which peppers she thought were hot.  The chicken tasted okay, but it was nothing spectacular.  I continued to eat the entree and finished it.  It could have at least have been made from white meat since it was not spicy.  Oh well.

They don't serve Sichuan food here.  It is too heavy and sauce oriented.  I would say that it has to be some mixture of Cantonese, Hunan and Mandarin. Will I return, probably not.  Why?  I just don't like the Station Square location.  There are other Sesame Inn in Ross Township and Dormont.  I will most likely try again at one of those related restaurants to see if I like anything else on the menu.  For better or worse, it is one of the better Chinese in the area."	review	T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 4, u'cool': 3}	3.11	{u'profile': 6, u'funny': 113, u'cute': 21, u'plain': 439, u'writer': 57, u'list': 9, u'note': 242, u'photos': 22, u'hot': 102, u'more': 40, u'cool': 189}	[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	38	[18kPq7GPye-YQ3LyKyAZPw, rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, K2PDI4_GJLUTwjq0jA2viQ, -NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ, -wOgMGHvNJHQDfqUgX19Qg, 9BApDAgV8POMQ6VffTz3aA, 1Awm0xagllRcAHi4_sNptQ, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 3rtKBEuyR7yr85ufRuYlWQ, qptKNzXrua8-WWwpp846RA, LTWY2Ee-SYu8ItVOebD3CQ, 5yBkoRI9DSKH9aMV3Vadpw, GubdNFoDAsiwE6bWIr97cQ, GUrPmYze-oF6NFDJusiSNw, BaXgT8NGTnWjNUUnOdpRWA, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, ZuQ87LQYWRw3AHj-jEiQ1Q, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, y3zerFCOqhXcmzSXtpKLfg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, d1iH2EPxYMQLbKHN03Y7XQ, z4IHuLSqhPGeiXbf0mogLg, -uslRG-oovrIkvJu2LBW2g, Milv8k4zZsoCaNFZugKtJw, GHbj_ybwEXcN4R8qt7O-cg, GD6xTWmzBozrvdpVCzzLHg, -eveIridBm0gm6hRCNKZeA, qdZOzAWV1fT6QHauVRBB2w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, cMkqpHAb4ZomwMymSQfwBQ, 43f077NnbY_-kupvfczzYg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, 7F8HLz3ErL8b7CNgQqqH9g, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, mfIngaq8vE8XmKETBEl2gw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, TI88k_ezEWaj_XZSiuBNGA, nMXCCLssk_5SBi3wp41ToQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, XmOiFAy168781nzRAYOetg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 4a2SjXc0U4k4MRN2EdcNwg, YFYPlO4RruHZUBVe8quvOw, ZE9-b-6ekeaA9mSIt-ZTyA, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, cD9d9XFoC_bETPzjpnRj9g, R0P932lPm7Be6-YTKwwPOA, Cs6JRqxOADfeqli20F5Yhg, ZPolhetd6Od5_VhXPbFIxw, x_MbMxRc_FVlZrTqclfUyw, BuA2twnOXZOP1yQ6rqi9SQ, CZPATh5KP19TNp9sInf_rA, FDZua5BFEhEOET8e2ztkRw, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, sh1_HCgh_axTFSXoZfjqOA, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 53HVEUP1GLUEwFtespdVdQ, YwVmrb_UVy19HtDs1OwoVg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, LOpKVZIW5-66DocLLQHhhA, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, Sx2OM_pi-NsqNiZk1fMNXw, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, QmykNasFdjyaQ3K8oME3fQ, 4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A, 4YKfzKiJlque5Dd32QD-KQ, MYQ9cWCfqzE5BFEdXUv3fw, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, icf8Tr75xv-QOnI7wZX9Xw, 16TBKdpSyHma7CM5eHy99Q, XJMe4WxPhYNXKZUlZ-29NA]	Sal	808	user	{u'funny': 1209, u'useful': 2147, u'cool': 1251}	2009-01

It was quite interesting to see that the servers were quite obviously the children of the owners.  The amazing part was that they were quite professional during the duration of our meal.  Having had some fairly bad Chinese food in the area, I was on my last ounce of hope.

The interior is very sparsely decorated, but it reminded me of the little mom and pop places that I saw in Suzhou, China.  I was intrigued by this little Chinese restaurant in Homestead that was packed with locals.  Since I hadn't satisfied my Chinese craving yet, I already knew what I wanted and told the server the entire order:

Panfried Pierogi/Dumplings
Egg Drop Soup
Wonton Soup
Yeung chow (combo fried rice, no peas, no carrots)
Generals (Piquancy 7/10)

As I ordered, the kids were bringing out food to the other tables and it smelled wonderful.  Our soups arrived rather fast.  I went directly for my egg drop soup and was hit by this taste of white pepper.  Too much white pepper was in the soup.  I tried the wonton soup and it had the same issue -- too much white pepper.  This wasn't a deal-killer since the soups both still had a decent flavor; I just had to get past that white pepper flavor.  The egg drop soup was a bit heavier than I would normally get, but after the ones at Mandarin Gourmet and Sesame Inn, I was happy.

The panfried dumplings arrived to the table.  My eyes and belly were happy to see these dumplings.  They were a little thick, but the meat and the shells were well-flavored and the dipping sauce had a good mixture of sweet, salty, and acidic.  We quickly devoured the dumplings with a swiftness.  I did find it amusing that they were shaped just like pierogies -- was this to help the locals?  I don't know, but they tasted good.  While eating our food, the same dish was being served to table after table on a sizzling skillet and it smelled wonderful.  When the little bus-girl took our plate, I asked her what it was and she said it was the Garlic Chicken -- I am adding that to my list of items to try here.

Our entrees arrived; the General's Chicken -- true to form -- was completely different from every single other Chinese restaurant in the world.  It was the chunk, fried variety with a fairly dark, thick sauce.  It was definitely NOT piquant at a 7 (mental note for a 10 next time) and the flavor was different.  It was slightly salty with a bitter taste that wasn't offensive.  I wish it were a bit more piquant.   

The combination fried rice wasn't bad.  It was better than most fried rices, but it used the salad shrimp.  I have become used to eating my yeung chow fried rice with actual shrimp in it.  Other than that little irksome item, I enjoyed my friend rice.  It wasn't drenched in soy sauce even though it was a little oily.

We ate all of the food, and as I was reviewing the check, the old lady behind me placed her order.  She asked for a 10 with a side of chili sauce.  I was surprised but I realized that my instincts were correct about ordering a 10/10 next time. 

This is a 3.5 stars, but bumped up to 4 since I know I will return."	review	T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 1}	3.11	{u'profile': 6, u'funny': 113, u'cute': 21, u'plain': 439, u'writer': 57, u'list': 9, u'note': 242, u'photos': 22, u'hot': 102, u'more': 40, u'cool': 189}	[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]	38	[18kPq7GPye-YQ3LyKyAZPw, rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog, K2PDI4_GJLUTwjq0jA2viQ, -NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ, -wOgMGHvNJHQDfqUgX19Qg, 9BApDAgV8POMQ6VffTz3aA, 1Awm0xagllRcAHi4_sNptQ, iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA, 3rtKBEuyR7yr85ufRuYlWQ, qptKNzXrua8-WWwpp846RA, LTWY2Ee-SYu8ItVOebD3CQ, 5yBkoRI9DSKH9aMV3Vadpw, GubdNFoDAsiwE6bWIr97cQ, GUrPmYze-oF6NFDJusiSNw, BaXgT8NGTnWjNUUnOdpRWA, 10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg, ZuQ87LQYWRw3AHj-jEiQ1Q, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, y3zerFCOqhXcmzSXtpKLfg, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, d1iH2EPxYMQLbKHN03Y7XQ, z4IHuLSqhPGeiXbf0mogLg, -uslRG-oovrIkvJu2LBW2g, Milv8k4zZsoCaNFZugKtJw, GHbj_ybwEXcN4R8qt7O-cg, GD6xTWmzBozrvdpVCzzLHg, -eveIridBm0gm6hRCNKZeA, qdZOzAWV1fT6QHauVRBB2w, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, cMkqpHAb4ZomwMymSQfwBQ, 43f077NnbY_-kupvfczzYg, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, 7F8HLz3ErL8b7CNgQqqH9g, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, mfIngaq8vE8XmKETBEl2gw, hYaLWF-gCxMMsTEMTMw-sQ, TI88k_ezEWaj_XZSiuBNGA, nMXCCLssk_5SBi3wp41ToQ, uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ, XmOiFAy168781nzRAYOetg, clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg, 4a2SjXc0U4k4MRN2EdcNwg, YFYPlO4RruHZUBVe8quvOw, ZE9-b-6ekeaA9mSIt-ZTyA, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg, cD9d9XFoC_bETPzjpnRj9g, R0P932lPm7Be6-YTKwwPOA, Cs6JRqxOADfeqli20F5Yhg, ZPolhetd6Od5_VhXPbFIxw, x_MbMxRc_FVlZrTqclfUyw, BuA2twnOXZOP1yQ6rqi9SQ, CZPATh5KP19TNp9sInf_rA, FDZua5BFEhEOET8e2ztkRw, 1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg, sh1_HCgh_axTFSXoZfjqOA, yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ, jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA, 53HVEUP1GLUEwFtespdVdQ, YwVmrb_UVy19HtDs1OwoVg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, LOpKVZIW5-66DocLLQHhhA, 9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA, YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, Sx2OM_pi-NsqNiZk1fMNXw, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, cF2CgY-_zNTBtQpaP_CeVw, cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg, QmykNasFdjyaQ3K8oME3fQ, 4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A, 4YKfzKiJlque5Dd32QD-KQ, MYQ9cWCfqzE5BFEdXUv3fw, 2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg, icf8Tr75xv-QOnI7wZX9Xw, 16TBKdpSyHma7CM5eHy99Q, XJMe4WxPhYNXKZUlZ-29NA]	Sal	808	user	{u'funny': 1209, u'useful': 2147, u'cool': 1251}	2009-01
829	-vVQyTVHitF6TOHGijVXxQ	2009-11-09	QDagEN0p8NCsq_WZAXEhng	3	"I think I was expecting a tad more when I entered these doors.  We were seated promptly and ordered the following items:

Pepsi
Tea
Five killer wings (5/5 fat heads in heat)
Ten original wings (4/5 fat heads heat)
Chicken soup
Smokey burger with fries
Side of Homemade chips

I was really jonesing to try the Killer wings...I really enjoy food that is piquant with good flavor.  The waitress just looked at me and asked if I was certain and I said yes.  After waiting for a few minutes we recieved the wings and the chicken soup.  The chicken soup was really nothing special.  It was obvious that it was made from fresh ingredients, but the flavors were not in balance -- certain herbs were masking the flavor of the chicken partially while completely smothering the taste of the vegetables.

I put my nose close to the wings and took a good whiff.  I was suprised to find that my nose did not retaliate.  I knew right off the bat that they were not as hot as billed.  I dug into the killer wings and ate two of them before I switched to the original wings.  I was not impressed.  The heat is NOT commensurate with the flavor in either the killer nor the original.  In fact, the flavor of the killer wings was subpar compared to the original wings.  Do not get these wings unless you hang out with a bunch of people that have no affinity for piquant foods and you are trying to show off.  The flavor is just not worth it.  The original wings, while not as bad as the killer, had a bit of a sweet base to them rather than the acidic base that I am so fond of...if you like sweeter things, you may like these.  I will be going for one of the 3/5 fat heads in piquancy next time to see if there is a better equilibrium between heat and flavor.

As I was finishing the last of the wings, our sandwich arrived.  The flavor was somewhat lackluster; there was just too much bread.  As I was eating the hamburger, I started to speak to our server and she asked how the sandwich was.  She stated that for some reason the company they purchase bread from gave them rolls that were larger than normal and she was wondering what we thought.  Being myself, I told her about the overabundance of bread.

Lately me and my girl have been visiting the Heidelburg location. I love the food, it really tastes homemade, much like something a grandmother would make, complete with gobs of butter and side dishes. Prices are low, selection is great, but dont expect fine dining by any means. 

Service is hit or miss at pretty much all of them; if you have lunch at any Kings, you will likely be waited on by a sweet but sarcastic  older lady who has been doing the waiting thing for 30 years and knows her game. Seek out this lady.  My experience with the younger crowd at night isnt the same.

Im in my 30s now, and very little has changed, other than the Fox Chapel location was remodeled about 10 years ago to look less like a diner, which was a big fail.

If you're intimidated by spending $100 or more on a complete meal for 1 person, then this is not the place for you. Knowing that we had other plans for our evening, my date and I cut the meal short with appetizers, salad, and a bottle of one of the lesser expensive wines they offer, which was $54 a bottle. Our check was still $120, and we left hungry. Which is a shame, because the little of what we did have, we fully enjoyed. There are plenty of Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh, and many of them are very, very good - where one can enjoy a meal for a fraction of what it costs here.	review	vGI3dbg5zFRXBg4eVVmGSg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	3.33	{u'note': 1, u'plain': 1, u'cool': 2}	[]	0	[]	Patrick	15	user	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 32, u'cool': 1}	2010-11

I wish all those people who are bitching about large portions would get a life before they ruin it for me.

The service would be the only reason I cannot give 5 stars.  It's ok.  Not great.  When they get busy, stuff gets forgotten about and it is not unusual to have to flag someone down.

Also, I wish it was open later.

I can appreciate that some smaller businesses might have trouble installing a credit card system in their store/resturant, but could you perhaps provide an ATM?  In the past, this would deter me from eating at this place. 

Looking at a standard breakfast menu, I decided to go with a tuna melt instead. What I got was a cold tuna salad sandwich with a slice of cheese on toast. I had ordered a melt being in the mood for a warm meal, but to no avail. One day later I can't even remember what my side was. I suppose it didn't leave much of an impression on me.  I have to say that the dessert was really good! The cherry pecan pie! I have not seen this concoction anywhere else but this was awesome! The cherries were not the sweet canned variety, but a pie worthy tart topped with sugar. I think I want to make this pie with my parents next harvest of our cherry tree!

My first impression is ""Eh.""  I am learning how crazy Pittsburghers are over breakfast! Seriously, waiting 30 minutes for a table at a tiny diner with a menu that reads as follows:  

""2 eggs and toast $x.xx""
""2 eggs, meat, and toast $x.xx""
""2 eggs and pancake $x.xx""

I ordered a special, which apparently changes at weekly or monthly. The name slips my mind but I will describe it thus: homemade mac and cheese (not the processed powder stuff!) with mini shell pasta. Crumbled crackers topped this concoction that tastes eerily like my grandmother's. She is Italian by the way. The mac and cheese has a variety of 3 different sausages sliced: knackwurst, bratwurst, and Weisswurst. The portion was large! I had to take home about 1/3 of my meal. Maybe the breads and side salad filled me up. :) In my opinion, it was good but doesn't do well as a leftover. 

My dessert consisted of German chocolate cake. I know, I know...how original. BUT I LOVE GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE!!!! And yes, I do know that German chocolate was created in America by a man with the last name of German...STILL LOVE IT!!!

Moonstones is deceptively small looking from the outside, but on the inside there are as many things to see as there are spiritual paths. 

After years of searching, I found a pendulum! I was so surprised to find the unassuming tiny metal acorn literally jump at me! I had assumed that what I needed would be an ornate crystal pendulum, but ""great things come in small packages"". After I took it home it took no time to get acquainted with it. 

The store contains many crystals, gems, jewelry, oils, and even jars of dried herbs. There were around 60 different bumper stickers to chooses from. And hard to find matchstick incense. It is exactly what you think, a match you strike that burns as incense. Speaking of which, I was disappointed to not find any ""pick your own"" incense sticks. My supply is quite depleted, and I need more. I did but a very dainty scarf from the selection of hats and clothing on the top most floor of the labyrinth. 

I hope to attend one of the interesting classes that I have seen mentioned. It does appear that the list needs to be updated. 

I also LOVE how the shopkeepers don't keep a hawk's eyes on you. Instead they allow you to spend your time browsing the merchandise alone. After all, it is difficult to hear a small voice when an item is calling out to you if you are anxious from unwelcome stares."	review	q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg	{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 1}	4.11	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 4, u'plain': 60, u'writer': 12, u'list': 1, u'note': 17, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 23, u'more': 11, u'cool': 44}	[2011, 2012, 2013]	7	[DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, fFoRIzbwpMiv3BvfdtdlXQ, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, _7Lg8iTWpFc0O7PEA8FmbQ, 9VchlXuamJnUX5gcqgJwjw, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, HIlrU4ShA10pNwwhc4xSaA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, QcGi0cDzzGLb3LmiI33Psg, kJgP5Kb5muMRA6gqWWEbWA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, 8IjVESbd_bQcPN_AIAY5hw, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 8ylnDiXbPXv0FL08vhAdMw, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw]	Kay	433	user	{u'funny': 174, u'useful': 596, u'cool': 209}	2010-08

As they may be stunning to behold, from afar each one is pretty much the same thing. This shop is another place that tosses sauce and cheese on bread and serves it to their patrons. Ok, so they DO have a slightly different take, throwing the cold shredded cheese onto the pie as soon as the dough is out of the oven. This does not melt the cheese, and I do see how the pizza would be cold after heaping on the cheese.  Some customers may like it, me, not so much. I tried the Italian hoagie.  It was a good size and the meat was flavorful. But that's about it. They put oil on the sandwich, but no other dressing. I expected a nice tangy flavor to compliment the meat but was disappointed. My date ordered a hot sausage hoagie. I didn't sample it, he liked it, but it was way too messy. The bread got soggy and the darn thing fell apart. It looked more like tomato soup with sausage than a sandwich.  The staff did seem pretty nice, even trying to keep a smile while dealing with the stress of a busy crowded restaurant. The dining room is also a bit cramped. There are plenty of booths, but the tables are rather close together and hard to maneuver between. Hungry patrons also are constantly getting up to visit the soda fountain.

The eggs were average, and the bacon was pretty skimpy, but the pancakes. Ohhhhhhh the pancakes! If it wasn't for these scrumptious staples of breakfast I would never know why it was worth waiting 30 minutes for a table. I ordered the pumpkin pancakes. These this are filling! I could only eat 1 1/2 before being stuffed like the Thanksgiving turkey. Mmmm stuff a turkey with pumpkin pancake .............. anyway. I usually need syrup to add flavor to this sweet treat, but I didn't need any here! I also tried Darren's chocolate chip pancakes. The had so many semisweet chips in them I thought they were stuffed pancakes at first! Soooooo good but even one round cake would make me feel a bit sick from sugar overload.

""They have more than pizza ""he protested, but pizza we got anyway. And WOW! Enter a seafood variation on the detested entree. I have tried seafood pizza at various places before and received imitation ""crab"" and some mini shrimp sauteed in butter, but THIS pizza blows them away! Clams, scallops, and sliced shrimp of the larger variety covered a perfect crust that was both crispy and soft. If you are a seafood lover, this is the perfect pie for you!

When stepping into the restaurant the first thing I noticed were glass cases storing food. It had the feel of a cafeteria or at best a deli at a gas station convenient store. Not feeling adventurous I got the gyro meal, which is a good deal. The fries were cooked to perfection, but lacked flavor. I had to dump salt on them, which is never a good thing unless you as for unsalted fries. The gyro itself was mediocre. The ingredients inside were fresh and made to order, but I did have to use a knife and fork to eat it as the pita was just a bit too small of the large mass of the contents. The slice of chocolate cake, while a descent size, was rather tasteless. The icing was pretty good, but the cake itself had almost no flavor, perhaps freezer burn. It did seem as if the cake had been frozen. I also felt like the harried girl taking orders behind the counter was overworked. She apparently had no time to take a wet cloth the the tables. I kind of felt bad for her.

Instead just the Greek symbol for male/female adorn the restroom enterance. The atmosphere was fun, yhe crowd rather easy going. Drinks were expensive and as I handle my alcohol well, my ""date"" paid a premium price to get me my birthday buzz. The dj played techno, and every 4th song was a Lady Gaga song. NO KIDDING!

The decor is amazing and so is the food. I had the Porchetta panino (pulled pork Shoulder with horseradish apple salsa) which came with these parsely-seasoned home fries. All of it was amazing. Like Darren (I was so jealous he got to go there back in February and I didn't), I had the Torta di Cioccolatta, and it was godly. The service was on-target too. I love this place and that it's so close to where I now work.

Darren suggested the Original Oyster House for our afternoon meal. Mmmm seafood! I could go for some good seafood, especially fresh oysters! Now, I am from an area not far from the ocean, and every year we had a community oyster roast, you know: fried, steamed, and raw oysters. 

Ummm, yeah. Big let down. I should know better than to have high expectations. If I wanted Long John Silvers, or better still Captain D's (look it up if you never heard of Captain D's), then I'd hit up one up, AND get a friendlier server to boot. I also bet I could get into a ladies room without needing a key elsewhere, or even some SWEET N LOW for my tea! Sorry...the more I write the angrier I am getting. One thing I am starting to notice about this area, it seems acceptable to have curt or even rude service. I suppose I was jaded before.

Ok, the food itself. The side of coleslaw was rather good. It tasted fresh and creamy! The crabcake...(can I call it that?) was more like a clump of Stove Top Stuffing and a tiny bit of crab meat. The two jumbo fried shrimp were ok. At least they weren't too greasy. And the frigg'n ""original oyster""... WHERE IS THE OYSTER??? Nothing but breading. I think I saw something resembling an oyster in there somewhere. And every entree had to be fried.

They also overdress their salads, and the service is choppy but friendly. I liked the decor myself. Overall, it is a very average restaurant from my POV.	review	q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	4.11	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 4, u'plain': 60, u'writer': 12, u'list': 1, u'note': 17, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 23, u'more': 11, u'cool': 44}	[2011, 2012, 2013]	7	[DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, fFoRIzbwpMiv3BvfdtdlXQ, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, _7Lg8iTWpFc0O7PEA8FmbQ, 9VchlXuamJnUX5gcqgJwjw, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, HIlrU4ShA10pNwwhc4xSaA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, QcGi0cDzzGLb3LmiI33Psg, kJgP5Kb5muMRA6gqWWEbWA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, 8IjVESbd_bQcPN_AIAY5hw, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 8ylnDiXbPXv0FL08vhAdMw, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw]	Kay	433	user	{u'funny': 174, u'useful': 596, u'cool': 209}	2010-08

Very moist and sweet. Also, as a side, I had the broccoli which was perfectly steamed. The service was awesome, and the place has an old-time charm to it. It worked for me.

This is one of those revamped locations. Large flat screen TV, electric fireplace, and lounging chairs! But my greatest excitement came from the soda fountain. It is a touch screen operated dispenser. Push the button for what you want (I got diet coke), and you are given the choice of your soda alone or with one of six flavor additives. Lime, grape, orange, cherry, lemon, and raspberry! I wanted to play with each flavor, but didn't. The food quality itself honestly isn't bad for fast food. Wendy's really has improved! The burger wasn't as greasy as usual and the fries are crunchy and full of flavor! I love the sea salt! They also has a small bakery selection. Darren and I shared an Oreo brownie.

My Chicken Madrid was excellent. The braised chicken came with sofrito, smoked pineapple, crispy polenta, and a salad of fennel, radish and celery. So good!!! 

Darren and I both shared the Chocolate Mousse Cake and the Malted Bread Pudding with malted chocolate ice cream, and they were each amazing.

I am in love with food ""from across the pond"" and have had a difficult time finding a place that accurately portrays the differences between Americanized and genuine English cuisine. I had a very difficult time picking just one entree to eat from the extensive menu, after all, who could pick a favorite child from a full brood. This was also one of the few places within the past year that I actually got excited over trying. The server is very witty, loves his job, had answers to any questions we had, and is Irish. LOVE that accent! 

The Scotch eggs (I won't describe this palate teaser as many reviewers below describe them accurately) were amazing! Our server explained that they are also served for breakfast with maple syrup. I so badly want to try this breakfast staple and maybe catch a football game (aka soccer to us Yanks) . 

I ordered the ""Toad in a Hole"" as described on the menu : Four fresh Local bangers (English sausage) in Yorkshire pudding baked golden brown and covered in our Jameson onion gravy. I can't even find the words to describe how tasty this was! I even had to take some of this home to finish later. The best way to describe the baked Yorkshire pudding is like the thin dough used to wrap a hot dog when making pigs in a blanket, light and airy and crispy. Darren ordered the Shepard's pie with lamb, and OMG, as a Shepherd's pie lover, this was the best I have EVER tasted! I can't wait to go back and try more things! When asked about the unique flavors, our server told us the chef uses sage to flavor the bangers and Shepherd's pie.

I wish I knew what Guy recommended so I could decided what to try from the massive selection! I am not a burger person, but the hot pot roast and fries with gravy sounded pretty good to me! When I saw the gigantic plate coming from the kitchen I knew right away I couldn't finish it. For the price, the portion size alone is a value!

I did also order Wedding soup. Something I never even heard of before moving to Pittsburgh, The soup itself was very delicious. Not bland and with few meatballs (which is FINE with me!). At least I didn't have to ask for the Parmesan cheese, the server brought it out with the soup.

My meal itself was just okay. The bread was kind of tough and hard to cut. The beef didn't have much flavor, but the gravy helped this. The fries, sadly, tasted like the oil they were cooked in needed changed badly. At first I though maybe it was just that there was still skin left on the potatoes, but Darren pointed out the oil problem.

Another comment, WHAT IS WITH THIS AREA AND CURT SERVERS??? If you aren't from Pittsburgh I think you'll be shocked at the rudeness. Darren seems used to it (swearing that ""they aren't being rude"")...and if this is what you get used to here, I am heartbroken. Is friendly service too much to ask for?

If I decide to come back, I will try a different sandwich."	review	q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 0}	4.11	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 4, u'plain': 60, u'writer': 12, u'list': 1, u'note': 17, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 23, u'more': 11, u'cool': 44}	[2011, 2012, 2013]	7	[DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, fFoRIzbwpMiv3BvfdtdlXQ, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, _7Lg8iTWpFc0O7PEA8FmbQ, 9VchlXuamJnUX5gcqgJwjw, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, HIlrU4ShA10pNwwhc4xSaA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, QcGi0cDzzGLb3LmiI33Psg, kJgP5Kb5muMRA6gqWWEbWA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, 8IjVESbd_bQcPN_AIAY5hw, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 8ylnDiXbPXv0FL08vhAdMw, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw]	Kay	433	user	{u'funny': 174, u'useful': 596, u'cool': 209}	2010-08

Very few sports venues have a roof that opens, and the dome shape was consistent with the hockey theme. I'm sorry that I couldn't see the roof when it was able to be opened, but I bet it was impressive.

Forget Red Lobster, if you want quality seafood and you are not by the ocean, this is THE place. One this occasion I wanted crabs (duh) and muscles. So what did I order? A steampot naturally! This pot contained legs, scallops, muscles, and the standard corn and potatoes.  As is tradition, I asked for a side of Old Bay and a bottle of malt vinegar to create my own paste, which I greedily dunk the meat in. The server, Nicole, was very patient as I requested these things and when I asked for Sweet N Low for my iced tea, I wasn't upset when she explained that they didn't carry it. 

I got a side of hushpuppies to accompany my feast and was not disappointed in the least. I believe I may have converted Darren when he tried one after he told me he didn't like hushpuppies. 

Growing up close to the Chesapeake Bay area, I have perfected the art of picking crabs and managed to get all of the meat out of almost every leg segment in whole. Darren loves watching me at work, never using a fork, and rarely using the nut crackers, or what they call crab crackers. These scallops were the best I have ever had! Seared on only one side and deliciously soft and juicy on the inside. The muscles were also amazing! I was saddened that I didn't have an endless plate of scallops and muscles. I have to say that I did have a pleasant surprise. When I was finished I looked under the plate that was in the pot and noticed an extra scallop and extra muscle! It felt like getting a small bonus!  

I got the chocolate cake for dessert. It was huge! The flavor was ok, but I took home the few bites I couldn't finish and discovered that the cake tasted better after sitting in the fridge for a few hours.  I CAN'T WAIT TO EAT AT JOE'S AGAIN!"	review	q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg	{u'funny': 2, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 2}	4.11	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 4, u'plain': 60, u'writer': 12, u'list': 1, u'note': 17, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 23, u'more': 11, u'cool': 44}	[2011, 2012, 2013]	7	[DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, fFoRIzbwpMiv3BvfdtdlXQ, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, _7Lg8iTWpFc0O7PEA8FmbQ, 9VchlXuamJnUX5gcqgJwjw, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, HIlrU4ShA10pNwwhc4xSaA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, QcGi0cDzzGLb3LmiI33Psg, kJgP5Kb5muMRA6gqWWEbWA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, 8IjVESbd_bQcPN_AIAY5hw, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 8ylnDiXbPXv0FL08vhAdMw, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw]	Kay	433	user	{u'funny': 174, u'useful': 596, u'cool': 209}	2010-08

Knoebels wins only because the food is generally much better, it's cheaper, and the lines aren't as long for rides. I can see why Kennywood is so treasured around here, though, since the rides are usually worth the long waits. Luckily, rides don't make me sick like they do Darren. The Exterminator is my personal favorite ride along with the Jackrabbit, but the majority of them won't disappoint thrillseekers. Recommended, but look for coupons or something since tix can be expensive.

First of all, the place was filthy. I understand that they may have been busy, but I almost expected a rat to scurry across the floor at any given moment. I don't think I saw anyone run a washcloth over the counters or tables the entire time I was in this hole. 

Second, the service was God awful! There were 2 people serving/cooking. The guy came up to my companion and I, asked what we wanted to order, then before I had half a second to open my mouth and utter a sound the ""server"" walled away and served someone else. He did this no less than twice. I would have walked right out if this hadn't been the only place open to get a bit to eat within a reasonable walking distance from a concert venue I was attempting to visit. There was a woman making the food, and she didn't change her latex gloves between handling raw meat and cooked meat or rinse her hands when she handled meat to grabbing the coleslaw by hand. She seemed to know which orders were which, but the guy was having trouble keeping them straight. Maybe he could have TRIED to write them down. 

And lastly, the food. I had ordered the roast beef and an extra side of loaded fries. The bread was hard, not toasted hard, stale hard. The beef was just OK, but not bad. But the fries, the staple of a Primanti sandwich, were disgusting! The oil that they had been fried in tasted like it hadn't been changed in over a year, which I am sure is not the case...I hope..."	review	q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 0}	4.11	{u'profile': 1, u'funny': 4, u'plain': 60, u'writer': 12, u'list': 1, u'note': 17, u'photos': 1, u'hot': 23, u'more': 11, u'cool': 44}	[2011, 2012, 2013]	7	[DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw, tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A, zQftN0Vsh9F0iTy3bIVh1Q, fFoRIzbwpMiv3BvfdtdlXQ, u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw, fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw, _7Lg8iTWpFc0O7PEA8FmbQ, 9VchlXuamJnUX5gcqgJwjw, 4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg, yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q, 6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA, sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw, oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg, Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw, sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg, bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ, HIlrU4ShA10pNwwhc4xSaA, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, QcGi0cDzzGLb3LmiI33Psg, kJgP5Kb5muMRA6gqWWEbWA, _vwy7eTm8V5yHw_QxhVDBA, 8IjVESbd_bQcPN_AIAY5hw, jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA, 8ylnDiXbPXv0FL08vhAdMw, UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw]	Kay	433	user	{u'funny': 174, u'useful': 596, u'cool': 209}	2010-08

I was greeted by the hostess,who was polite and friendly, and I informed her that I was alone.  She had just arrived, as well, and wasn't exactly sure what was going on yet, so she asked (the manager?) where she should seat me.  After receiving guidance, she brought me to a table towards the back.  It had not yet been cleaned after the previous guests had dined.  So, she quickly got it cleared off, grabbed a rag, and wiped it down.

The waitress came rather quickly to take my drink order.  She was extremely friendly.  I ordered coffee and water, which she went and got while I looked over the menu.  She returned, and took my order.  I ordered the Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Special - Three slices of French toast made with Pittsburgh's own Jenny Lee® Cinnamon Swirl, two farm-fresh eggs, with bacon or sausage (I chose sausage), and your choice of potato (I went with the cheesy hash brown casserole).  I also added an orange juice.  She went and put my order in, while I waited, and came back with it after not too long.   The eggs were cooked exactly how I wanted them, the cheesy hash brown casserole and the french toast were both delicious.  I also enjoyed the sausage which was pretty typical.

Kings Family Restaurant featured a very friendly staff, great prices, and tasty food.  I am pleased and will definitely come back again."	review	7KoVg5QMjYu8taLFSE7hNA	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	4.04	{u'plain': 1, u'cool': 1}	[]	2	[vEdw1Q-NSZwYpaFVnz3u9A, YaDoz22xUMKYKgrtK5cZ5Q, 11Ydte1VfE85UHK24d4QRQ]	Jason	27	user	{u'funny': 18, u'useful': 20, u'cool': 10}	2011-11
932	P0kIWqaoOjIJEtJBydFvoA	2014-10-30	FnZxFcKjjKBubTlLDvcQqQ	5	"I learned of this place from watching Rick Sebak's program, ""The Joys of Millvale"" on WQED (for those not familiar with Pittsburgh, that's Pittsburgh's PBS affiliate - they gave the world Mr. Rogers).  Everything looked so delicious on the show that I knew I had to go see this place in person.  So, on the way back from the Pittsburgh Mills, I stopped by Millvale and went and found it.  

Millvale is a quaint little suburb, and the street where Jean-Marc's is located is, as well.  You will feel like you had driven back in time to the first half of the 20th Century.  It was a Saturday afternoon.  The street was relatively busy, but I found metered parking right across the street from the bakery.  A Quarter got me an hour of parking, which was way more than I needed, because the service was friendly and efficient.  

I walked into the little bakery.  Immediately, I saw Jean-Marc behind the counter near the cash register, assisting some other customers.  He was not the one who helped me, but it is just nice to see the owner and baker in the place, especially when he's helping people.  The lady behind the counter directly in front of me finished up with the customer ahead of me, looked me in the eye, and asked how she could help me.  I told her that I was here for some Macarons.  She asked me if i wanted a dozen or a half dozen.  I looked at the prices and decided on a half dozen.  Then she asked me what flavors I wanted.  This was not an easy decision, because they have so many, and they all sounded delicious.  I opted for Peanut Butter and Jelly, Marzipan, Lemon, Raspberry, Mango Passion Fruit, and Nutella.  She boxed them up for me, I paid, and five minutes after parking my car, I was on my way.

I was supposed to come here with a friend, but since I made a spontaneous decision to stop by alone, I promised her I would save her one or three Macarons.  Well, the whole half-dozen made it home alright.  But later that afternoon, I got hungry and wanted a snack.  So, I decided to try one.  I soon discovered that just eating one is not possible.  They were so sweet and light and fluffy, and they melted deliciously right in my mouth.  The six of them lasted only a couple of minutes.  I guess I'll just have to go back for more and try some of their delicious Palmiers (Elephant Ears, basically)!  

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!  If I ever get married, it would have to be a woman who is willing to get our wedding cake from here, because that is a deal breaker!"	review	7KoVg5QMjYu8taLFSE7hNA	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 1}	4.04	{u'plain': 1, u'cool': 1}	[]	2	[vEdw1Q-NSZwYpaFVnz3u9A, YaDoz22xUMKYKgrtK5cZ5Q, 11Ydte1VfE85UHK24d4QRQ]	Jason	27	user	{u'funny': 18, u'useful': 20, u'cool': 10}	2011-11
933	Q4ULAiIE2qCA4RYplCTrUQ	2014-09-18	4dYq8CCrRKgz2QaGTFmcYw	5	"For those not familiar with Primanti Bros. (you obviously are not from Pittsburgh), their signature items are delicious, giant sandwiches featuring your choice of meat, provolone cheese, their delicious fries, Italian dressing based cole slaw, and tomato on two slices of Italian bread.  The sandwich was invented to serve the workers in the warehouses nearby during the early Twentieth Century.  By including the fries and slaw on the sandwich, it made it easier to serve them quickly.  They have other items on the menu, like soup and their ""Soon to be Famous Chicken Wings,"" but the sandwiches are definitely the featured attraction.

I had been to Primanti Brothers before, but this was my first visit to the original location in the Strip District.  As I expected, the original location was definitely a cut above the rest.  I went at 2 p.m. on a Saturday afternoon during football season.  When I arrived, I walked in and found an open seat at the bar.  The person who previously sat there had just left, so as I sat, the bartender (I didn't get her name.  But she was cute!) offered to clean the spot for me, and did.  She immediately asked me what I was drinking.  I ordered an I.C. (Iron City) Light, which she promptly went and got for me.  Then, right away, she asked me if I knew what I wanted to eat.  I told her I did, and she took my order.  I ordered my favorite, the Kielbasa and Cheese (see the photo I posted).  She put the order in right away, and, since the grill is actually behind the bar, right near where I was sitting, I saw the cook begin to prepare it.  It didn't take very long before the bartender brought me my sandwich, cut in half, and served on wax paper.  It also didn't take very long before I had completely consumed the sandwich, as the bartender observed after seeing it gone and the wax paper crumpled into a ball, ""Well!  It looks like you enjoyed that!""  I confirmed that I did.  It was definitely better than the Kielbasa and Cheese that I had had at other Primanti Bros. locations before.  While I was eating my sandwich, I noticed the cook preparing the same for someone else, and I noticed her dropping the sausage into the fryer.  I don't know whether or not this is a common practice in restaurants, as all the restaurants where I worked didn't serve kielbasa.  But I thought it was interesting, and I think it gave the sausage a nice flavor, and rendered it both crispy and juicy.  I was definitely pleased.

The one negative about this place is that it is cash-only.  It's not really a big deal because there is an ATM inside.  I don't know how much the fee is to use it, but if you want to be safe, then just come prepared.

Finally, I have one more suggestion.  The Strip District has a nice market nearby, as well as a lot of street vendors selling fresh fruit, baked goods, souvenirs, and sports memorabilia from the local teams.  You may want to arrive early and spend some time browsing before dining, or check it out afterwards.

I love Primanti Brothers, and will definitely be checking out the original location in the Strip District the next time I get to return to this wonderful city!"	review	7KoVg5QMjYu8taLFSE7hNA	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	4.04	{u'plain': 1, u'cool': 1}	[]	2	[vEdw1Q-NSZwYpaFVnz3u9A, YaDoz22xUMKYKgrtK5cZ5Q, 11Ydte1VfE85UHK24d4QRQ]	Jason	27	user	{u'funny': 18, u'useful': 20, u'cool': 10}	2011-11

The man waiting on me (I'm guessing the owner) was very nice, both dropping off and picking up, even though I lost my ticket. Turn around time was OK for a cleaners that don't do cleaning on premises. What's my problem then? Price. My daughter's dress was $18 to clean. I think that's close to what I paid for it. My ladies shirts were $6/unit. Maybe I'm not calibrated on Pgh prices but this seems outrageous. My search continues for a neighborhood cleaners. BTW, they do men's tailoring there on-site and it looks like it might be a big part of their business.

Moving from LA recently where for some reason EVERYTHING is more expensive... except nail salons! Now, I am by no means, a spa rat but I do like to pamper the toes every now and again. So one afternoon when I had some spare time, I gave them a try. I was totally underwhelmed. From nail polish in the front with dust on it (how long have they been there?) To sitting in a spa chair with ripped upholstery I felt neither pampered nor impressed. I MIGHT have looked beyond such things because of the affordable price till I got home and realized that my nails hadn't been cut short as I had very clearly asked nor had she taking care of an ingrown toenail. A week later I had to cut my own toes and ruin my all right looking pedicure. This place doesn't feel clean or inviting. The decor was junkie and old and cluttered. I will say that everyone was very friendly and they did take me right away when I walked in. I was really pulling for you, Future Nails.

Our first visit was at lunch and it was just OK. We weren't blown away nor were we impressed. But I will always opt to support a local Mom & Pop shop if all things are equal. This last visit was the pits.

It was 5:30pm on a Saturday night. We were one of two tables. This is usually an indication of something fishy (excuse the pun.) Appetizer was edamame. It was overcooked and left uneaten. I am not the adventurous sushi order-er; I had California rolls and spicy tuna. The tuna rolls were mostly spicy sauce then fish, very mayonnaise-y and unsatisfying. As for my CA rolls, the avocado was all brown! Not just the parts on the top (because I checked!) all the way through. When I brought it to the staff's attention her response was ""Oh, yea. Avocado is like banana. They get brown very easily and we cut that yesterday."" WHAT?!? They did bring me another batch (that was part brown, part green) but it was too late. This was my first sushi restaurant EVER that we left half the rolls on the plate uneaten. Since we were all still hungry, my daughter picked up the table tent listing all the desserts. Yuck! Filthy. Not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever. When I set it back is when I noticed the wall also needed a good wipe down. Needless to say, we skipped dessert.

I've always thought that puffed pastries and Sundays go hand in hand. So although Kribel's is a bit out of the way for me, I made the trip. And was pleasantly surprised. The woman behind the counter could not have been lovelier. The inside is very ""old school"" and there seems to be a deli attached although I didn't do any ordering from that side of the business. There was an abundance of cookies to choose from and they even gave my daughter a sample cookie for her cuteness. Our samples were great and I have high hopes for the other cookies!

943	tDGZPb1XIR5yGCL7pNwU4g	2012-09-19	auLYd9u6Pw4B3xgZfY325A	4	I've tried both the spa services (massage) and hair salon and both times I was quite pleased. My friend won a complimentary hair cut and highlights. Since she is both happy with her current place and is far away, kindly gave me her gift card. I saw Glen, who I believe is the owner and his assistant. Everyone was very kind and I walked out quite happy with the result. He carefully listened to what kind of cut and style I wanted and gave me just that. There was the ever annoying attempt to up-sell me on hair care products that most salons do but it wasn't too bad. Unfortunately, I can't speak on price for the hair style as my gift card covered all but tip. My guess is that Glen's services are more then my current budget, but due to 2 pleasant experiences, I will go back again and try a junior stylist. Parking is conveniently located across the street at the parking garage and they do validate. Prices seem to be on the high end for Pittsburgh but I suppose you get what you pay for! The salon is clean and comfortable. The staff is across the board friendly. Sign up for their email list and get offers for discounted services. Would recommend.	review	6VEID9yjoYWFZkUcP_GNBg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 3, u'cool': 0}	3.89	{u'plain': 4, u'writer': 1, u'note': 2, u'hot': 8, u'more': 2, u'cool': 9}	[2012, 2013]	3	[NZdPZgewY0_I9UnnMzF1tg, MoW3zCCMza1Gl2nZXZMQFg, F13QWT7ZraVWHQNjoXGR3A, -vlqge106CFN-Wvm2JGmUA, 3QBsE9YLLVIps970T7txIA, 3GyMTaxBiquKldHr_qlcOw, 7S1TB-r6_q44Zqvp70nQvQ, bmxu4F8lUGN_drdqp5mNlw, QOoB0I8kFgSBPfPkpEFIeQ, MALJmvGfmmynBpE4Gbm7KQ, 9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA, UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA, 7Tt0Qmp1nWDy7-TnXLRyMA, nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ, kFr_7FllbwtoKURRdfQvKQ, u7yqbJUNZdYs2g_kElOqMw, pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA, MrSawcYxMVpXqL9RoM3H8w, So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ, 2lPh-2xrV4vbdSKNWr77AQ, 7zTxaHMwf9HUn17j_2sM8A, S0EUCzGk71fJcje62gYeMA, 8IAYraBKEVH8sdE_0VNvhg, jhnTq1FqoPOkUGhfNYFM6Q, -18axVy1uZt-xVwo3xegKg, rz70x-9d9ThkNkwwwK0lfQ, 1o0t62K_cFYTIYesZ4woiw, gEuGe2By1e9G3ZKXuMGzrw, B82zyakhRDQ0juGoqohl5w, Odilx2skdMQgaEWx1lglNQ]	Kristy	111	user	{u'funny': 45, u'useful': 185, u'cool': 64}	2010-05

Interesting facts about the city for the adults and out-of-towners. A ride on the river for the kids (and they get to drive the boat!) The staff was all quite friendly. Make a reservation and arrive early to get a window seat and/or sit with your group.

I decided to use a local business to do my dry cleaning. I dropped off 3 shirts at this establishment just before Thanksgiving. It is now late January. I have stopped by more than a half dozen times and have been given only ONE of the shirts. They have offered $20 a shirt for the shirts they lost. Those shirts are worth at least $50 each, and I refuse to take under $30 for each. I am tired of the run around, tired of promised phone calls that never happen (they have NEVER called me).  I wouldn't use their services again if you paid me to.	review	d_zE235hKwYut4gyhx3HoA	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	1.75	{}	[]	0	[]	Dean	4	user	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	2013-01

Everything was ready in less than two weeks. These suits were brand new and on the expensive side. I didn't know who to trust them with. I went to Rossi's because a friend highly recommended them. My friend had a tuxedo custom made by Rossi's. 

I am extremely happy with the end results!

I wanted a European cut on jackets and no break on the slacks; a nice tailored look. The suits look awesome. I'm going to go through my closet and take some of my older suits to be tailored (some of my older suits are a little looser fitting; I now like the more tailored European look). Juliano (the owner) will shorten the length of my jackets, take the sides in and shorten my slacks. They'll look brand new.

As for the price, I'm very happy. I wouldn't go to the cheapest barber in town (for obvious reason). I feel the same about a good tailor. As for the service, they couldn't be nicer.

On my last visit to Pittsburgh I was looking for a nice bar/pub/lounge to grab dinner and watch a Penguins playoff game.  A friend of mine who lived in the area recommended Rocky's.  As I walked in the door I was pleasantly approached by the server and shown a table. It was clean, welcoming and the lounge was busy. It was Friday night and the special was the fish fry.  I ordered the fish and in the meantime I sipped on a draft brew.  The order was delivered to my table in no time.  The fish and sides were tasty and the portion size was large. As I was watching the game and enjoying the heck out of my dinner I noticed a dessert case with a nice selection of cakes.  Well needless to say I got a togo box for what was left of my dinner and ordered a slice of cheesecake.  Another good choice!  At the end of night the Penguins couldn't pull off the win over the Rangers but I definitely have a new ""go to"" when I'm in town.  Another star could be added for a smoke free environment.  I don't smoke but I understand they have a nice outdoor area for those who do."	review	gi_1bkKWbipVsGigjPKs0Q	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	4.0	{}	[]	0	[]	Gail	3	user	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}	2014-05

He ordered the large version of fish sandwich.  Rocky's is famous for their fish.  Three large breaded and fried fish filets, bun and fries for under $10.  Needless to say, he had no complaints and brought home more than he ate.
I ordered the meatball grill.  It was delish.  Served on thick cut Italian bread and made ""grilled cheese"" (mozzarella) style.  Meatballs and tomato sauce are both good!  Also, served with fries.  I brought home half the sandwich.

Have been there during the years it was less than clean, to the present where it is almost clean. This place is a neighborhood standard that for some reason compels you to return, even if your experience was less than stellar. Fancy it is not. Gourmet it is definitely not. Every item on the menu seems to come from a can, bag ,bucket or box. The wait staff is often clueless and changes like the wind. I have never had the same server twice. But the fact is you get a decent meal for a decent price and always have a little to take home. Yes, the salad bar is very basic. Not every item is a fresh as it should be. The iced tea often takes on the taste of Lord knows what. However,  the fried fish dinner is one of the best I have had anywhere in Picksburg. Their meatloaf is terrific as are several of their hoagies. In a nutshell, this place has a lot of flaws. Like we all do. A few upgrades like a better wait staff, fresh gravy instead of their gallon bucket brand, homemade sauce instead of whatever canned stuff they are using would jump this review to 5 stars. Rocky's is worth going to. You will definitely find something you like and you will definitely go back. Decent food, decent price, good portions and an overall pleasant experience.	review	bWaJUPa1E1yzJnNAgCEfog	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}	2.5	{}	[]	0	[]	John	4	user	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 1}	2014-08

Pasquarelli's Pizza House jumped off of the page as the place to try. Yes, on name alone, haha. After being told that they don't deliver to me and then that they do, the actual order took place. No, you can't get double or extra pepperoni(-1 the pizza is not that good that they can dictate what you want on it) or extra cheese. No, you can't get a menu and no we are out of Hot Sausage. Too many ""no's"" to me. No, we don't have Coke or Pepsi. No, we don't have bottles.(-1 for all the ""No's"")
Large Pie with Pepperoni and Ham
2 cans of Mountain Dew 
$19.18, seemed a little expensive compared to prices on Mt Wash, where this would have been $14-$16, no mas. (-1)
The delivery occurred ahead of the stated 45 minute time, delivery guy was great.
 The dough was a little tough, in fact my jaw hurt after 2 slices. I tried another piece about a half hour later and it was really tasty and the crust was a bit softer. I also like the ""Dirty Crust"" (+1), they flip the crust down to size covering a presauced section, putting a small bit of sauce inside the crust. They sauce the crust edges sloppy and get cheese all over the top, Dirty Crust.

They have the best part of NY style pizza right there on the counter: The Shakies, all the goodies that you can shake on top. I'm a Garlic Powder, Parmesan, Red Pepper guy myself. I hate when a shop says it's NY style and has no shakies, that's part of the style, go to NYC and you'll see. If you get the slice special, you won't be eating for awhile, good deal for the money you pay. O and they have wings, mmmm, god-like wings made the right way with Frank's Red Hot.
 The only reason that I cannot give Venazia's 5 stars is because of a couple bad delivery experiences. The last time I waited an hour and 15 minutes before calling to check my status. The owner(Brian?) answered and explained that I had called back and said that i was picking it up instead( o, really?). I asked him why he didn't call after the order sat over an hour, plus the fact that whenever I call they already have my number, so a different number would have called and no one on this earth knew I ordered anyways. He didn't seem to care either way, which is bad customer service, especially for a loyal customer. So I felt kind of slighted.

The good thing about living at Mill & Southern is a great bar selection within a block or so, OK so I'm into dive bars, it's almost heaven. The first time I went into the Timeout, it reminded me of a hundred bars back home in Pittsburgh. I didn't feel alot of personality the first couple times, not until I met and made some friends. It's a bar that plays pool, as you can see by all the trophy's and the bulletin board cluttered with league info. I'm a casual player so it's a little intimidating at first, but everyone there is great. That's the allure; the people.

I've lived and traveled all across our country, Canada and Mexico and the dog's at Ted's are about the best. Coming a close 2nd is the Texas Hot Lunch in Hanover, Pennsyltucky near Gettysburg. Cooked over a flame right in front of you, I usually get a All Beef  (or 2) with chili & cheese and crispy fries made the same way. Their chili is so tasty, it makes you want to send to a chemist to get the recipe. The rush's run at different times, too, so be prepared to wait for your dog, it's worth it. Oh, and as mentioned, bring cash, although there is a Bank of America ATM in the same parking lot.	review	FNbm3ycU2BF8C17UFfWzOg	{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 1}	3.98	{u'funny': 5, u'plain': 1, u'note': 3, u'hot': 1, u'cool': 5, u'more': 2}	[]	4	[Zff7xm0J-C7hV1z3j-JipQ, qASPib1Z8ft8e96dtbh66w, AaZdXn0I6F5bdIVwGpxdDA, 1cR5-LZcSYcACxhGe3DEVA, Jf62QjVE2IMsOHQGSHtHkg, l81ILmOhky5bG7o4r3rkhQ, y3G08sNWisaMAhqad77RYg, 6NZxXHJq99yuOgHwtu24ig, 9PiM3lRzswoAe3qV6wtqJg, QDdwYP1uqPzI5z3NO5LXog, RV8M-M1xllmxvinufpbKDQ, 9YyMxhRX0Hk1D8uP0wyLzw, FvfKgrunRKYLCZ4u4-Gicg, DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ, S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA, 9ZTT9qjdSiav9iaBMMpcxA, -j1W5imz-mwvvITXZj0bqw, o3nVk6jCFAJ0VeL9qP_8Bw, jEfGe0n8T-ILKMboLHyQlw, waONrWF1bBrsTsCoyrGrDQ, gRfaRz-WRshEFf2bNsbvvg, aq856O5GuK6hujU7wO_gJA, 6jqcMsgwL6tJfdqwqinv5g, kX5028G8pMSuv2xv_lpG9g, btnC1QQbJkmZ_Hxa5ot2Gg, d4DBPKAtY2CrPLCeWWOqOA, 55vh9dt6laS5tTFZ0BLh0A, JtwWEFC6sDAyihuIM970yg, hlakJKjeDQO6nH0Nexnv0w, OyOVQ7XErqO9V39aaQozlQ]	Amish	125	user	{u'funny': 94, u'useful': 227, u'cool': 91}	2007-07

 It was around noon on a Sunday and fairly empty. I walked right in, ordered and started chatting with Mike, the owners son. Good guy, I can relate, being the son of a restaurant owner. It's funny to hear someone else tell the same stories, ha. He fixed me up with 2 slices of pepperoni and a pepperoni roll. The pepperoni roll was BOMB, so good, I loved the little bit of burnt cheese around the edges, so yummy. The slices were great, too. Thin, New York style and a few shakers of goodness-crushed peppers, parmesean cheese, etc. 
The place was really clean, lots of seating in the back and plenty to drink. Beer or Soda available.

The big question: Are they better than Fiori's? Well, they are neck and neck in all honesty. I like that Fiori's is a little sweeter, but both pies are great. The pepperoni roll will bring me back for sure.
